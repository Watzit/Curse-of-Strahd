In life, Count Strahd von Zarovich was a ruthlessly effective conqueror. Over decades of brutal military campaigning, he defeated his rivals and forged a na­ tion. Retiring from war, Strahd settled in the beauti­ ful valley where he'd won his greatest victory. There, in the way of his ancestors, he spilled his blood into the earth, sealing a pact between himself and the land. In honor of his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia, he named the valley Barovia and con­ structed his fortress-home, Castle Ravenloft.

Strahd had spent his youth at war fighting along­ side Ulmed, the founder of the Ulmist Inquisition, but as he reached his middle years he sought the comforts of family. He invited his kin to live with him at Castle Ravenloft, and was eventually joined by his younger brother, Sergei.

Sergei was everything Strahd wasn't-youthful, empathic, and warm. Soon after he arrived in Baro­ via, the younger von Zarovich and a local villager named Tatyana fell in love. Strahd resented his brother, even more so after meeting Tatyana and experiencing her pure kindness. Obsessing over her, Strahd sought to woo Tatyana but was soundly rebuffed. Unwilling to accept her wishes or Sergei as his better, Strahd delved into the sinister secrets of his land and came to learn of the Amber Temple. There, amid hidden lore and the imprisoned ves­ tiges of ancient evil, Strahd first encountered the Dark Powers-and made a bargain with them to regain his vitality and ensnare Tatyana's heart.

The day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, Strahd murdered Sergei and, to seal his pact with the Dark Powers, drank his brother's blood. He revealed  
his new might to Tatyana, expecting to enthrall

her. Instead, horrified by Sergei's murder, Tatyana fled Strahd, ultimately leaping from the height of Castle Ravenloft to escape him and vanishing into the Mists. At the same time, traitors from among the castle's guards and wedding's guests rose up to assassinate Strahd. Despite suffering count- less wounds, Strahd did not die. The nature of

his bargain with the Dark Powers was revealed, and Strahd became the multiverse's first vampire. A night of bloody rage followed, and when dawn touched the parapets of Castle Ravenloft, no living soul survived within. But Strahd remained.

Little is known of the origins of the Domains of Dread, but what's certain is that they began here. Strahd's villainy, his connection to his land, and his entanglement with the sinister priests of Osybus (detailed in chapter 5) drew all of Barovia into the Shadowfell. This began a succession of torments that haunt the Count still and spill forth to drag oth­ ers into the Land of the Mists.

STRAHD'S POWERS AND DOMINION

Strahd is a patient and dramatic mastermind. His statistics are similar to those of a vampire and his spellcasting prowess is formidable, enabling him  
to face most threats directly. Strahd ever seeks to escape his boredom and draws challenges out for as long as it entertains him. However, if insulted, the Darklord can turn all of Barovia against his foes.

The Ancient, the Land. Strahd is bound to Baro­ via and it to him in a way few rulers or Darklords understand. As part of this relationship, Strahd knows when any creature enters or dies violently within Barovia-and takes personal offense when his agents or the domain's wolves are slain. Strahd can also manifest a variety of dramatic effects, such as causing his voice to be heard on the wind, mak­ ing his visage appear in the clouds, changing the weather, and so forth. He can't use these effects to aid him in combat, but they can make his presence known throughout the land.

Master Vampire. Strahd eagerly plays the parts of nobleman and gracious host, but drops these pretenses when they no longer serve him, revealing his megalomania and monstrous nature. Strahd believes he has no peers and eagerly cultivates servants, particularly vampire spawn. He hasn't survived for ages by being reckless, though, and he retreats or sacrifices even his favorite agents when necessary.

Vistani Sanctuary. The ancient Vistani for­ tune-teller Madame Eva makes her home in Baro­ via. She knows much of Strahd and has occasion­ ally served as an intermediary between him and various Vistani bands when it serves her own mys­ terious goals. As part of this arrangement, Strahd avoids harming Vistani who travel within his land.

Closing the Borders. Strahd closes Barovia's borders whenever something that interests him threatens to escape, surrounding the domain with poisonous mist. Those who enter the Mists choke and are affected as detailed in "The Mists" section at the start of this chapter.

STRAHD'S TORMENT

Eternity is a cruel consort. The following are just a few of the torments Strahd endures:

-   Through endless generations, Tatyana has been reincarnated again and again. Each time Strahd believes he can undo his past failures, win Tatya­ na's heart, and in so doing free himself from his ages-long curse. Each time, though, Tatyana re­ nounces him once more.
    
-   Strahd chafes within the borders of his domain. His desire for novelty, passion, and conquest matches his thirst for blood.
    
-   Strahd considers Barovia's people dull inferiors, even as he resents them for the simple pleasures of hope and companionship they possess.

ROLEPLAYING STRAHD

Strahd von Zarovich is infinitely egotistical, cruel, and manipulative-a charming monster who wears the trappings of power and class. The vampire victimizes his subjects whenever the urge strikes, reveling in the fear he causes.
