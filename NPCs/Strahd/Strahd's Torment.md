Eternity is a cruel consort. The following are just a few of the torments Strahd endures:

-   Through endless generations, [[Tatyana]] has been reincarnated again and again. Each time Strahd believes he can undo his past failures, win [[Tatyana]]'s heart, and in so doing free himself from his ages-long curse. Each time, though, [[Tatyana]] renounces him once more.
-   Strahd chafes within the borders of his domain. His desire for novelty, passion, and conquest matches his thirst for blood.
-   Strahd considers [[Barovia]]'s people dull inferiors, even as he resents them for the simple pleasures of hope and companionship they possess.
