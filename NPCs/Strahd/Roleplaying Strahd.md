[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.

When he was alive, [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of [[Tatyana]], but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.

In life, [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still-not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] why he's preying on [[Ireena]] Kolyana, he tells them that [[Ireena]]'s body is the host for [[Tatyana]]'s soul, and [[Tatyana]]'s soul belongs to him.

[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] for a time-playthings to possess or discard as he desires.

If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.

[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] von Zarovich is infinitely egotistical, cruel, and manipulative-a charming monster who wears the trappings of power and class. The vampire victimizes his subjects whenever the urge strikes, reveling in the fear he causes.

[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] isn't a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it-he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The.characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading.
