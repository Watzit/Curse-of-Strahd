TURN [[IREENA]] KOLYANA

Strahd's unrequited love for [[Tatyana]] drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, [[Count Strahd von Zarovich]] glimpsed the young woman [[Ireena]] Kolyana in the village of [[Barovia]] and felt extreme deja vu. [[Ireena]] looked exactly like [[Tatyana]]! Strahd now believes that [[Ireena]] is the latest reincarnation of [[Tatyana]], and thus he seeks to claim her.

Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit [[Ireena]] twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home-the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of [[Barovia]]-and drank her blood. He intends to kill [[Ireena]] during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.

FIND RUDOLPH VAN RICHTEN

Although he is usually focused on making [[Ireena]] Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to [[Barovia]]. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching [[Barovia]] for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.

Chapter 5 describes the town ofVallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.

. ·: Stra·hd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If

they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued-even more so if the character displays uncom­ mon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.
