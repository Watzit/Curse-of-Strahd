Compared to [[Barovians]]:they are flamboyant. Vistanidressinbrightclothes,laughoften,ariddrink heartily. As much as they feel at home-in._[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s dreary land, they know they can leave it.whenever they" please and aren't damned fo spend eteinity there.

Each family or clan of [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] is its own little geron­ tocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder. cl!-rrfes the_ bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] way of life. [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.

[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|STRAHD]]'S [[NPCs/Vistani|VISTANI]] SERVANTS

During one of [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group ofVistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. TheseVistani not only nursed [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] de­ clared that allVistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to

the present day. Thus,[[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] can travel freely through the fog that surrounds [[Barovia]], without fear of harm or entrapment.

[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] honors his debt to theVistani in part because he envies theVistani way of life-the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admi­ ration of them.

In the centuries since [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] became a vampire, manyVistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]], to the extent that they consider him their king.[[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] who serve [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] are less lively and friendly than normalVistani, and their hearts are poi­ soned with dark intentions. [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. TheseVistani will lie to protect the  
vampire, and they fear the con­  
sequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, [[NPCs/[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]/[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]|[[NPCs]]/[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]/[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]|[[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]]]'s

[[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] pretend to be helpful, but the infor­ mation they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventur­ ers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds [[Barovia]]. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.

BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS

The [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:

The souls of those who die inBarovia can't escape to

the afterlife. They are prisoners in [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s domain.  
, SomeVistaniwomenareblessedwithprescience.Of all the great [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] fortune-tellers, none compares

to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.  
A prescient Vistana can't see her own future or  
the future of anotherVistana. It is the burden of theVistani's great gift that their own fates can't

be divined.

[[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave con­ sequences for the one who utters such a curse.

[[NPCs/Vistani|VISTANI]] CURSES

A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can't utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.

The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw

to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the Vistana's proficiency bonus+ theVistana's Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a remove curse spell, a greater restoration $pell, or similar magic.

It doesn't end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect..

When the curse ends, theVistana soffers a harmful psychicbacklash.Theamountofthispsychicdamage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.

The Vistana chooses the curse's effect from the options that follow; otherVistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] who uttered them when they end:

EVIL EYE

As an action, aVistana can target a creature within 10 feet that theVistana can see. This magical ability, which theVistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice), but requires neither so­ matic nor material components. The spell save DC is 8 + the caster's proficiency bonus+ the caster's Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn.

AVistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against aVistana's Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all [[NPCs/Vistani|Vistani]] for 24 hours.
