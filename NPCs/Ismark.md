Ismark (LG male human veteran) is a young man who sits by himself at a corner table, sipping his wine. Other villagers call him "lsmark the Lesser" because he has lived in the shadow of his father for most of his life.

lSMARK TME LESSER

Ismark isn't a typically dour Barovian. He invites the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted sister, [[Ireena]] Kolyana. If they agree to help, he takes them to the bur­ gomaster's residence (area E4). He wants the characters to help him escort [[Ireena]] to Vallaki, a settlement in the heart of the valley, beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft and (he hopes) beyond the reach of [[Strahd]]. Ismark knows that moving [[Ireena]] is a gamble, since she's vul­ nerable to [[Strahd]] when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions that Vallaki is well defended.

Ismark is as tight-lipped as any of the other Barovian villagers, unless the talk deals with [[Ireena]] or [[Strahd]]. Ismark knows everything the other villagers know. He also knows that, for some unknown reason, [[Strahd]] is attracted to [[Ireena]] and desires her above all others.

If you used the "Plea for Help" adventure hook and the characters show Ismark the letter they received, he knows the burgomaster's handwriting well enough to confirm that the letter was not written by his father.

Ismark has spent most of his adult life training with weapons in the hope of one day confronting and killing the [[Strahd]]. If the characters suggest that he accompany them, Ismark agrees provided that [[Ireena]] is first taken to a place of safety. As long as Ismark accompanies the characters, he acts as a party member for the purpose of determining each character's share of experience points (though he gains no experience points himself).
