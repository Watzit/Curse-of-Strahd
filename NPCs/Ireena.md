Ireena's body is the host for [[Tatyana]]'s soul, and [[Tatyana]]'s soul belongs to him.

ROLEPLAYING IREENA

[[Ireena]], a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by [[Strahd]]. The villagers are afraid of her and avoid her. The characters are [[Ireena]]'s best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. She doesn't remember her early past. She doesn't know how she came to [[Barovia]] or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with [[Strahd]] are fuzzy memories, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes.

She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks. The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault, and he died three days ago. Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack.

She says that no one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Ismark]] take Kolyan Indirovich to the cemetery for proper burial. [[Ireena]] asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help [[Ismark]] deliver her father's body safely to Donavich, the local priest (area ES). She refuses to be taken to [[Vallaki]] or anywhere else while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor.
