**Vibe / Background Summary** 

  

Some time ago, [Character Name] was a tenacious investigator who worked as part of [the Material Plane city name’s] law enforcement. At that point in time, they were a human. One particular case haunted them, sprawling a years-long investigation with an elusive target. 

  

[Fill in details] 

  

They started to obsessively see patterns where - to all others - there were none. One late autumn night, a cryptic tip was left - leading to a dockside rendezvous under a thick fog. 

  

With their trusty firearm buried under their cloak, they waited patiently for a sign of their quarry - concealed by the fog and enveloped by twilight. Suddenly, the world fell to black. 

  

[Arrival in Ravenloft] When they woke up, they were face-down in a puddle, the taste of iron and dirt in their mouth. They pulled themselves to their feet. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and their firearm had fallen a few feet away from them.  

  

An unfamiliar hand reached out from their body to retrieve the weapon. Wirey, lithe and scaled [adjust this description depending on the chosen build/race- BUGBEAR]. Rationalising immediately that this must be the work of ill magic, their concern took a backseat as their eyes fell on a humanoid mound that lay face-down in the dirt a few short meters away. The heavy fog could not obfuscate the details from their keen eyes: fresh blood; and its source, a gunshot wound. 

  

On the wind, they heard the sound of galloping hooves. The sounds dispersed quickly and rigidly into a deliberate formation. A familiar tactic, though not one they had ever experienced from this perspective. They were being surrounded by perhaps a dozen or more officers and the opportunity to do anything about it was fading fast. They took in as much detail of the crime scene as possible before pulling away, vowing to clear their name and prove their innocence to the authorities of this unfamiliar town.

  

In the days that followed, they succeeded. If you can consider life in this _damned_ place success.

  

It has been [1 year]. 

  

Ravenloft has been less than kind to their obsessive tendencies. They don’t remember when they stopped trying to get home. They don’t remember when they accepted this new form as their own.

  

Their only focus has been on uncovering the true nature of this realm and the Dark Powers that shape it. Patterns emerge once more: undulating mists that move with intent, the strange clockwork routines in the citizenry - it all points to a dark design by unseen architects, treating sentience as a plaything. 

  

_And [I] will not stand for it, as long as I have breath._
