**(Marigold Lock-Vander)**

**Background Summary**

Marigold is from a long line of paladins that are seeking to ‘cleanse’ the world of the Dark Lands. Order established by my ancestor who returned from the Dark Lands to pass down the knowledge and prepare the next generation to complete the quest of destroying the Dark Lands and their lords/ladies.

Character is trained as a paladin, follower of the Dawn Father from an early age, and has been sent out on different tasks in the normal world before reaching their time of ( I am thinking along the lines of a Mormon’s years of service. Would quite like there to be a word for it, but not sure what!). Then they enter the Dark Lands. 

Other than the ancestor that established our families traditions and order, no other relatives have ever returned. The last one in was my great-aunt Judy. 

At this time, they have only recently entered into the Dark Lands at 29 years old, confident that they will succeed in the family mission, they set out. 

**From** Neverwinter. 

**Structure of family** 

Different family members take on different roles, admin, gardening etc. Those inclined and strong enough (often the shifters) in body. - and faith - train to become paladins. They apprentice with the closest (geographically) paladin family member, taking on jobs as an apprentice. Once deemed suitably mature, they can choose to follow the family path into the Dark Lands. I am my generations choice.

**Appearance** 

Medium build, about 5 6. They have flaming red striped hair, and look like a thunder cat cartoon. A flat elongated nose, slightly sharper canines (un-shifted, even more prominent when shifted) and pointed ears. Large orange eyes.
