_I am The Ancient, I am The Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god. My army settled in the valley, which I named after my father, the good King Barov. I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft, which I named for my deceased mother, Queen Ravenovia van Royen. They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I loved him for both. I hated him for both._

_…_

_From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others. A rare beauty, who was called “perfection,” “joy,” and “treasure.” Her name was Tatyana and I longed for her to be mine. I loved her with all my heart. I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her joy. But she spurned me! “Old One” was my name to her – “elder” and “brother” also. Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed. The date was set._

_…_

_With words she called me “brother,” but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name – “death.” It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it. But I had squandered mine. The death she saw in me turned her from me. And so I came to hate death, my death. My hate is very strong: I would not be called “death” so soon. I made a pact with Vampyr, a pact of Blood. On the day of the wedding, I killed Sergei, my brother. My pact was sealed with his blood, his…divinity._

_I found Tatyana weeping in the garden east of the Chapel. I soothed her, and she melted into my arms. We embraced in a kiss which lasted an eternity. But alas, eternity was too short, for her love for me turned to fear before my eyes. She fled from me. She would not let me explain, and a great anger swelled within me. She had to understand the pact I made for her! I pursued her. Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft and I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever._

_It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found._

_My old friend and a commander of my army, Leo Dilisnya, had chosen this night to betray me, and attempt to overthrow my rule. I returned to the chapel to find the wedding guests slaughtered by his men. Arrows from his guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead, forever._

_…_

_I have studied much in the ensuing centuries. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me. It is the sun and light I fear the most. But little else can harm me now. If I am killed in battle, I simply return to my tomb to rise again. Even a stake through my heart does not kill me, unless I am in my tomb. But the sword, that cursed sword that Sergei brought! I must dispose of that awful tool! I fear and hate it as much as the sun._

_…_

_The sorrow which filled my heart after the death of Tatyana came to fill all of Ravenloft. As is my hate, mine is a powerful sorrow. It pierced the hard stone walls, and took on a life of its own. Within one of the towers of my castle, a cruel heart has grown out of the very walls, coursing its painful reminders of my loss throughout my home. And yet, through grief, I have found strength. As I need sorrow, it needs me too, and so it becomes wounded in my stead during battle._

_…_

_I have learned much, too, about this land of Barovia. Ancient are its ways, ancient beyond the knowledge of the simple folk of the valley. Three powerful fanes dwelt in this valley long before my coming, and each approached me with an offer of a share in their powers over the elements. The Weaver asked of me the bounty of a fresh harvest, the Huntress asked of me the life of a hunter, and the Seeker asked of me the blood of a child, willingly given. I responded to each in turn by desecrating their shrines. Their servants now serve me, and thus I have become the Land._

_…_

_I brought darkness over the land, so that I may stalk my prey during the day. Despite the gloom, I found an oddity; the vineyards at the Wizard of Wines Winery continued to produce plentiful grapes. Ten years ago, my curiosity got the better of me, and I went searching. A quick charm of the man on watch and I had my answer; three gems of power. One gem of sunlight, and two of life. I took the gem of sunlight for myself. After years of magical experimentation, I was able to incorporate it into the Heart of Sorrow, and now find myself protected from the sun itself, my ancient enemy._

_…_

_I have often hunted for Tatyana. I have even felt her within my grasp, but she escapes me! She taunts me! She taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me? I now reside far below Ravenloft. I live among the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of this hollow castle of despair. I shall seal shut the walls of the stairs that none may disturb me._
