I love this campaign. A lot. It has so much potential, and it is so sandboxy that every playthrough can be completely different. I have DM'd this campaign twice, and played it once (and listened to an actual play podcast of it), and there are a couple of things I've picked up that I thought I would share. Some of it is personal preference, but hopefully some of it will be useful to others.

1. **Stack the Tarrokka deck. Kinda**
    

Having one (or more) items be located in Castle Ravenloft is not ideal. This happened when I was a player, and honestly knowing that we were supposed to retrieve an item from Ravenloft made it less....formidable. Knowing the cards foretold that my party would be able to steal something from Strahd's own home took away some of the mystery and made both Ravenloft and Strahd seem less daunting.

To avoid this, I suggest kinda stacking the Tarrokka deck. Go through and pick out all of the locations/people that you _really_ don't want (*cough cough* all of Ravenloft *cough*), but don't completely stack the deck. I stacked the deck the first time I DM'd and only kinda stacked it the second time, and I personally enjoyed the excitement of not knowing where exactly the adventure would take the party.

2. **Read Mandymod.**

Read it. Just do it. Hopefully everyone here already knows about Mandymod's amazing thread on this campaign, but if you don't, go read it. I didn't find it until halfway through my first time running the campaign, and it is a goldmine of ideas.

3. **Make the Dark Powers...DARK Powers**

As written, the consequences aren't too dire for making deals with the Dark Powers. My first time running the campaign, I went with the Dark Powers as written, and my players walked away from the Amber Temple as a bunch of smug, over-powered, funny-looking freaks. The side-effects were well-worth the upgrades in their eyes (seriously, all of my players made at least 2 deals). Don't let this happen (this was my first time as a DM ever, I didn't know any better).

Mandymod has some good ideas surrounding the dark powers, but I went a different way with it. The second time I ran it, I made the dark powers DARK. As in, you're lucky if you only take a stat hit for taking a deal. On the flip side, I also made the powers much more powerful.

For example, one of my players (our Paladin) took a deal with Fekre, the Queen of Poxes (Queen of Wounds in my campaign). In the book, making a deal with her gives you the ability to cast the Contagion spell three times, but you permanently reek of filth. That's not very interesting in my opinion. So instead, I made it so she gives you the ability to regrow/reattach limbs. These limbs are red and grotesque, but strong with the ability to hurl flame (I made it so Izek's arm was a result of a previous deal with Fekre). However, every time the player regrows someone's limb, he rolls a d6, and that corresponding stat decreases by 1 (for example, if he rolls a 1, his strength decreases by 1, from a 17 to a 16). This happens every time the paladin regrows a limb. By the end, his strength had decreased enough that he could no longer wear plate armor. But, he was able to help multiple people, including using the ability to reattach the Abbott's wings and regrow Mordenkainens tongue (which Strahd had cut out...long story), and those two were a HUGE help during the final confrontation. His decision to accept this deal had a huge impact on the campaign, both from an overall plot perspective and from a personal sacrifice perspective, and helped maintain the horror side of the campaign at a point when the players were starting to get used to how dark it was. It wasn't just a gimmicky power-up, which it runs the risk of being as-written.

If anyone is interested, I can do a write-up on what I did for all of the Dark Powers.

Edit: Here is my write-up for the revamped Dark Powers:

4. **Expand the Tome of Strahd. Please**

The Tome is something that is easily overlooked. What the book gives you for the Tome isn't all that interesting or helpful. The first time I ran this campaign, my players read what I gave them from the book then never looked at it again. When I was a player, my party read what the DM gave us from the book then never looked at it again. The second time I ran the campaign I didn't make this mistake. I found things online to incorporate into it, then expanded even farther than that, and broke it up into multiple entries that my players had to spend two in-game hours reading and deciphering. I added more history of Barovia into it (all from Strahd's perspective), as well as insights into how Strahd thinks, and even a puzzle that had to be deciphered. And my players _loved_ it. We had two sessions where they kept finding excuses to rest so they could read more of the Tome. They _wanted_ to read what Strahd wrote next. And they kept talking about it, even up to the last session! Expand the Tome for whatever you need to fit your campaign, and your players will appreciate it.

Edit: Here is my expanded Tome of Strahd:

The formatting got weird when I uploaded it from Word, but the important stuff is there. The notes in black are meant to be Strahd's own notes to himself. The notes in red are meant to be from other adventurers that have found the Tome before the players (and help give them hints to things). I specifically added notes to the passage where he mentions the Heart of Sorrow that show the casting spell he used (although it has been smeared and not all of it is readable), and to have other adventurer's add notes to that spell, giving hints at what the Heart of Sorrow could be (in my campaign, the HoS is one of the winery gems). I found a lot of this online, and these are two of the resources I used:

I believe I used one other source when creating it, but unfortunately cannot find it. If anyone sees something familiar and thinks they know where it is from, please let me know so I can give credit where credit is due.

The way I handled the tome was for every two hours a character spends reading the Tome in-game, they get one page (unfortunately the page formatting is messed up, sorry). There ended up being 29 entries.

5. **Listen to Your Players...and Go Off-Book**

Hopefully any DM knows to listen to your players and adapt as you go. But what I'm talking about here is listening to their table talk and expanding on their discussions, even just a passing comment. Some examples:

-the Tome of Strahd mentions Khazan the lich briefly. But my players latched onto the phrase of the Tome that mentions that Strahd does not know where Khazan's head is. So that became one of the parties ultimate goals. Even more important than finding the Holy Symbol, they needed to find Khazan's head. So that became a whole plotline, and Khazan became a major part of the campaign (the campaign probably would have been about 10 sessions shorter without this plotline)

-while at the Amber Temple, the players became very interested in the library, and decided they wanted to find a teleport spell (they had Mordenkainen with them, who would be able to learn the spell and cast it, if they could find it). Initially I didn't want to give this to them. I didn't want them to be able to just teleport wherever they wanted within Barovia. But they were very persistent. They spent almost two entire sessions trying to find this spell, so I finally relented and gave it to them....with a twist. Since they found this spell scroll in the Amber Temple, it's corrupted, so every time the spell learned from the scroll is used, the user gets 3 levels of exhaustion, and everyone else teleported with it gets 1 level of exhaustion. This kept them from jumping around Barovia at will, but gave them the satisfaction of achieving their goal

-there are books written by Blinsky in the Amber Temple's treasure room. When I read that, I thought that someone had just carried some of his books up here. When the players found them, they assumed Blinsky himself was evil and had been to the Amber Temple to make a deal with the Dark Powers. So I absolutely made it so Blinsky himself was evil and had been to the Amber Temple to make a deal with the Dark Powers. Players had a lot of fun tracking him down and dealing with him, and were very proud of themselves for "seeing through Blinsky's lies"

I never would have added any of this had my players not mentioned it or come up with their own ideas. Even though none of this was in the book, it made it much more interesting and rewarding for both me and the players.

6. **Strahd's Armor**

There's supposed to be an animated suit of armor at the top of Khazan's tower. Which can be fun, I ran it like that the first time I DM'd this campaign. But what if instead, it is Strahd's old armor? And it's made from Argonvost's hide?

I changed the animated armor to being just a _really_ good set of dragon scale mail. With the von Zarovich symbol emblazoned on the front. My party couldn't resist that stat boost. They were warned by several NPCs not to wear it, but they didn't listen (it was _REALLY_ good armor). They later learn that this was Strahd's armor (he just smirks when he sees they found it). He had it crafted from Argonvost's hide after slaying the dragon. He used it back when he was commanding armies and conquering countries, but now that he is the unopposed ruler of the land, he doesn't need it, so he doesn't care what happens to it. This makes for some interesting tension when the players go to Argonvostholt and have to explain to the Order of the Silver Dragon why one of them is wearing their leader's skin.

But remember, this is Strahd's armor. And the look of horror on the players faces when Strahd finally decides to reclaim his armor in the middle of the final fight, the plates ripping off the player and flying over to encompass Strahd, was absolutely priceless (I may be a little bit evil).

7. **Get that Silver out of Barovia...and Onto Your Weapons**

Vampire spawn are tough for low level characters. That group in the coffin maker shop can be deadly. Magic weapons can help, but magic weapons are few and far between in Barovia. So I decided to give my characters a little boost, while simultaneously giving them a good reason to explore Vallaki more, and make the players feel like they are being proactive in their fight against Strahd: I made vampires/vampire spawn take damage from silvered weapons, much like werewolves do.

Because silver is effective against him and his spawn, Strahd has banned silver. There are no silver coins in Barovia, there are iron coins instead. Most NPCs would be terrified if the players tried to buy something with silver coins. Instead, the players can use the silver coins they brought into Barovia to silver their weapons. Make a Keepers of the Feather-friendly blacksmith in Vallaki, and tell them it will be a couple days before the weapons are ready. Gives them a good excuse to explore the city, or to come back to it, and more time for the events of Vallaki to unfold naturally.

Players don't have enough silver coins on them? Make it so the Keepers of the Feather or some rogue Vistani have been collecting it for this very purpose. But wouldn't they get in trouble for having silvered weapons? Yes. Yes they would. And so would the blacksmith who helped them. Having to hide their weapons and rescue the blacksmith from jail was an interesting little side quest. They also better not lose or break that weapon, because the supply of silver is limited.

**8. Running the Vampire Himself**

This is much more personal preference than anything else, but after having played/run this campaign multiple times, I've found these are some key components for Strahd: He is arrogant, he is brutal, and he is a man of his word.

When I was a player, the DM had Strahd appear around Barovia a lot. We had a lot of conversations with Strahd. But that's basically all it amounted to. It got to the point where one of my fellow players was openly mocking Strahd, and there wasn't a consequence. That's no good. Strahd wasn't arrogant or brutal.

The first time I ran CoS, I tried to really up the horror aspect with Strahd, and I don't think I was successful. The players would see him observing him from afar, or would run into him in disguise, or other creepy things, but it got to the point where the players weren't too impressed when Strahd appeared. I had overplayed the creepiness to the point where it wasn't impactful anymore, and that's no good either.

My second time running it, I ran it differently. And this actually wasn't done intentionally, this was entirely my players fault (thank you players!). I was going to try to go the creepy route again, hoping I could do better. But my players threw me a curve ball. When they ran into Strahd in Vallaki, they offered him a deal: Kill all of the werewolves in Barovia, and we'll give you Ireena (at this point, the only thing they knew about the werewolves were that they existed, and this was a hail mary attempt to get Strahd to leave Vallaki). Obviously it takes Strahd no time at all to get rid of all of the werewolves, and he shows up to take his beloved back to Castle Ravenloft. This gave birth to my new strategy: Strahd is a man of his word. Not once does he lie to the players. Even NPCs tell the players that Strahd is a man of his word. Strahd sees the players (and all of Barovia) as so far beneath him that it's not even _worth_ lying to them. He has no need to. A villain who has no need to lie can be much more terrifying than one that constantly deceives everyone, if done right. This makes for some fun times with Strahd offering deals to the players and vice versa. But this point is really driven home when the players manage to find the Holy Symbol and manage to jail-break an NPC from Castle Ravenloft. Strahd tracks them down and tells them to hand over the holy symbol and the NPC or "they will rue this day". The players say no, but Strahd is not offering a deal, he is making a statement. So combat begins, and Strahd manages to take the Holy Symbol and the NPC, while killing another NPC, knocking out 2 players, destroying the windmill, and overall making the players rue that day. The players agree that is the most scared they have _ever_ been of any BBEG. Strahd told them what he was going to do, and then did it, because he is a man of his word. And there was nothing they could do to stop him.

(when it came to the final fight and the players were higher level, things obviously don't go Strahd's way, so when he says he will kill them all, he _can't_. For once he can't keep his word. And this contributes to his downward mental spiral, similar to Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender)

Other notes on running Strahd, that may be a little more specific to my campaign:

-Strahd got Ireena fairly early in my campaign. So Ireena spent most of the campaign as an inside source of info for the players (who used Message to communicate with her), but it wasn't easy for her. Strahd was very obviously abusive and controlling with her, which just made the players hate him even more. Every time the players saw her she had new bruises or injuries, Strahd rarely let her talk or go anywhere unescorted, and even went so far as to cut her food for her (against her wishes). This helped made the players feel more guilty, since she is there because of them, and made defeating him even more satisfying

-Strahd is a mamma's boy. I had her mentioned several times in the Tome, Strahd talked about her at dinner, and he even played them some music she had composed on the organ. Thanks to my brilliant and innovative players, this was his downfall. Long story short, they got the ability to resurrect the Queen from the Amber Temple and made a deal with him to resurrect her in exchange for something they really wanted. The players made friends with her and convinced her that Strahd was now Bad, resulting in her willingly trying to stop Strahd from fighting the players, and taking a hit for one of them. Strahd realizes he accidentally killed his own mother, and cue the downward spiral and final fight

-Strahd is arrogant as hell. He expects everything to be done his way, and he loves to rub his victories in others faces. He proudly displays his trophies clearly where everyone can see: the skull of Argonvost is (eventually) mounted above the front door of Ravenloft, and the Abbot's wings are displayed over the organ in the dining room.

"I have slayed dragons, conquered armies, and felled devas...what makes you think you stand a chance?"

This ended up much longer than I planned, but I hope some people found it interesting and useful!

EDIT: There was a lot of interest in my revamped Dark Powers and Tome of Strahd, so I added links.

EDIT 2: Thank you all so much for the rewards and the wonderful responses! This was a great thing to wake up to, I was not expecting this to blow up. I added a little more info regarding silver in Barovia that I thought of this morning!
