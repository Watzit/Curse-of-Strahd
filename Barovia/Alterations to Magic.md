The land of [[Barovia]] resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane. No spell-not even wish-allows one to escape from [[Strahd]]'s domain. Astral projection, teleport, plane shift, and similar spells cast for the purpose of leaving [[Barovia]] simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the etherealness spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from [[Strahd]]'s domain is pulled back into [[Barovia]] upon leaving that plane.

For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as sending), [[Strahd]]'s domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in [[Barovia]], as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in [[Barovia]].

While in [[Barovia]], characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally-with one proviso: [[Strahd]] can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell's recipient, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.

COSMETIC SPELL MODIFICATIONS

At your discretion, a spell can modified cosmeticaily to enhance the horrific atmosphere. Here are examples:

Alarm: Instead of hearing a inerital ping when the alarm is triggered, the caster hears a scream.

Bigby's hand: The conjured hand is skeletal.

Find familiar: The familiar is undead-not a celestial, fey, or fiend-and is immune to features that turn undead.

Find steed: The summoned steed is undead-not a celestial, fey, or fiend-and is immune to features that turn undead.

Find the path: A child's spirit appears and guides the caster to the desired location. The spirit can't be harmed and doesn't speak.

Fog cloud: Misty, harmless claws form in the fog. Gust of wind: A ghastly moan accompanies the summoned wind.

Mage hand: The summoned hand is skeletal.  

Maze: The surfaces of the demiplane's maze are made of mortared skulls and bones.

Phantom steed: The steed resembles a skeletal horse. Rary's telepathic bond: Characters linked together by the spell can't shake the feeling that something vile is telepathically eavesdropping on them.

Revivify: A creature restored to life by a revivify spell screams upon regaining consciousness, as though waking from some horrible nightmare.

Spirit guardians: The spirits.appear as ghostly, skeletal warriors.

Wall of stone: A wall created by the spell has ghastly faces sculpted into it, as though tortured spirits were somehow trapped within the stone.

RESURRECTION MADNESS

In [[Barovia]], the souls of the dead are as trapped as the souls of the living. They become caught in the mists and can't travel to the afterlife.

When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in [[Barovia]], likely forever. To determine how this madness is expressed, roll on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
