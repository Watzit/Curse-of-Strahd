Check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by [[Vistani|Vistani]].

"An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: [[Barovia]] VILLAGE to the east, TSER Pool to the northwest, and [[RAVENLOFT]]/[[Vallaki]] to the southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog."
___________________________________________________________________
The northwest fork leads down to the river and area G. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the vil­ lage of [[Barovia]] (area E). If the characters are traveling with [[Vistani|Vistani]], the [[Vistani|Vistani]] lead them along the northwest road to the [[Vistani|Vistani]] encampment.

The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.

Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.

THE HANGED ONE

As the characters leave the area, read: 
___________________________________________________________________
"You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you."
___________________________________________________________________
One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.

FORTUNES OF [[RAVENLOFT]]

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried in one of the graves. For each grave the charac­ ters dig up, there's a cumulative 10 percent chance of finding the treasure.
