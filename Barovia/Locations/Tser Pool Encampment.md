"The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.

The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.

The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge."
___________________________________________________________________
The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the [[Vistani|Vistani]] wagons and aren't easily startled.

If the characters are brought to this camp by the [[Vistani|Vistani]], their escorts remain at the camp and don't accompany the adventuring party any farther.

Twelve [[Vistani|Vistani]] (CN male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober [[Vistani|Vistani]] (CN male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.

Although the [[Vistani|Vistani]] in this camp are in league with [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]], they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.

If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the [[Vistani|Vistani]] tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "Madam Eva's Tent."

A VISTANA'S TALE

If the characters linger by the fire, one of the [[Vistani|Vistani]] recounts the following tale:
___________________________________________________________________
"A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of [[Barovia]] against the devil [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. "When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.

"The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other.

Their battle flew from the courtyards of [[Ravenloft]] to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River lvlis had already spirited him away."
___________________________________________________________________
The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the charÂ­ acters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.

MADAM EvA's TENT

If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:
___________________________________________________________________
"Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips."
___________________________________________________________________
Madam Eva (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual's past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don't want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)

Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of [[Barovia]] from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s (see appendix D for details). She does the vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] or bring harm to the [[Vistani|Vistani]]. She never gives aid and never asks for any.

TREASURE

For each [[Vistani|Vistani]] tent of wagon that the characters search, roll once on the, following table to determine what treasure is found:

|       |                                                                                                                |     |

  

 

FORTUNES OF [[RAVENLOFT]]

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the [[Vistani|Vistani]] wagons. Madam Eva grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.
