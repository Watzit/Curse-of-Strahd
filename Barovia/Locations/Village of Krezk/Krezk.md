Nestled on the edge of [[Barovia]], Krezk is a hardy and self-sustaining village. Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov scours the land for wine and other small luxuries, hoping to infuse some happiness into the villagers' lives. Krezk's most prominent landmark, the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]], looms high on a nearby cliff. This abbey is the home of a group of strange, afflicted creatures who work for a young and striking abbot. Some believe the abbot to be [[Strahd]] in disguise, although in truth he is a celestial being who has been corrupted by the [[Plane of Shadow/Domains of Dread/Dark Powers]].
