Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the [[Village of Barovia]] and one east of the village.

"The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence."

If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. 

The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in [[Vistani|Vistani]] wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.

The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s domain unless they are accompanied by [[Vistani|Vistani]]. The fog chokes any non-[[Vistani|Vistani]] that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see "[[Mists of Ravenloft]]" earlier in this chapter).

If [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] is defeated, the gates of [[Barovia]] swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.
