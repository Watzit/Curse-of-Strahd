"Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load."

If the characters approach the church doors, add:

"The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire."

The village priest, Donavich, lives here. Other Barovians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.

The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church on page 46.

E5A. HALL

The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot­ long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side ofthe hall, lead to adjacent chambers.

You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Sud­ denly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.

The scream comes from the church's undercroft (area ESg). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area ESf).

E5B. DoRu's BEDROOM

This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with

a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed's head­ board is a wooden holy symbol.

This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich's son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area ESg). It hasn't been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.

E5c. DONAVICH's BEDROOM

This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw­ filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.

This is Donavich's room and contains nothing of value.

E5D. TRAPDOOR

Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shin­ gles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man's screams of anguish can be heardthroughthedoor.

Donavichlostthekeytotheironpadlock.Ifthechainis removed and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the undercroft (area ESg).

E5E. OFFICE

An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them-a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.

An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.

For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little.

E5F. CHAPEL

Qburcb

(Jlru6,):, .. !

The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and bro-

ken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.

Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of can­ dles, and two well-used books: Hymns to the Dawn, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and The Blade of Truth: The Uses ofLogic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.
