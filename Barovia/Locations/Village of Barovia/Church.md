"Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports [[Castle Ravenloft]], stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load."
_______________________________________
If the characters approach the church doors, add:
_______________________________________
"The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire."
_______________________________________

The village priest, Donavich, lives here. Other [[Barovians]] shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.

The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church on page 46.

E5A. HALL
_______________________________________
The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-footlong hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.

You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.
_______________________________________
The scream comes from the church's undercroft (area ESg). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area ESf).

E5B. DORU'S BEDROOM
_______________________________________
This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden holy symbol.
_______________________________________

This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich's son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area ESg). It hasn't been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.

E5c. DONAVICH's BEDROOM
_______________________________________
This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.
_______________________________________
This is Donavich's room and contains nothing of value.

E5D. TRAPDOOR
_______________________________________
Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man's screams of anguish can be heard through the door.
_______________________________________
Donavich lost the key to the iron padlock. If the chain is removed and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the undercroft (area ESg).

E5E. OFFICE
_______________________________________
An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them-a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.
_______________________________________
An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.

For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little.
Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: Hymns to the Dawn, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and The Blade of Truth: The Uses ofLogic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.

E5F. CHAPEL
_________________
The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.

If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:
_________________
From beneath the chap I floor, you hear a young man's voice cry out, "Father! I'm starving!"
_________________
Donavich (LG male human acolyte) has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son Doru and several other villagers stormed [[Castle Ravenloft]] in revolt, having been lured there by a wizard in black robes who came to [[Barovia]] from a faraway land (see chapter 2, area M, for more information on the wizard). By all accounts, the wizard died by [[Strahd]]'s hand, and so too did Doru, who returned to his father as a vampire spawn. Donavich was able to trap his son in the church's undercroft, where he remains to this day.

Doru hasn't fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how  
to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.

In addition to the lore known to all [[Barovians]] (see "Barovian Lore" in chapter 2), Donavich knows the fol­ lowing useful information:

lreena Kolyana isn't the natural daughter of Kolyan lndirovich. Although [[Ireena]] never knew, Kolyan found her at the edge of the [[Svalich Woods]] near the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]]. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Kolyan ad­ opted her and loved her dearly.

Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the church graveyard, forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward [[Castle Ravenloft]]. (See "March of the Dead" in the "Special Events" section at the chapter's end.)

Funeral for the Burgomaster. If the characters bring Kolyan Indirovich's body to the church, Donavich presses the characters into helping him bury the bur­ gomaster in the cemetery (area E6) at dawn. During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the Morning­ lord in exchange for Kolyan Indirovich's deliverance from [[Barovia]].

Once Kolyan is put in the ground, Donavich suggests that [[Ireena]] be taken as far from [[Castle Ravenloft]] as possible. He proposes that the characters take her to the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Krezk]] (chapter 8) or, failing that, the fortified town of [[Vallaki]] (chapter 5). Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a bastion of good, has become a den of evil.

E5G. UNDERCROFT

The church's undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pil­ lars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Can­ dlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.

The shape is Doru, a vampire spawn sent by [[Strahd]] to torment Donavich and cast down the church. Doru is starved for blood and brave enough to attack a lone character. If the characters approach as a group, he does his best to avoid them while hissing, "I can smell your blood!" If they cut off his escape, he lunges forth and attacks.

If the characters restrain Doru and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they kill him and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall (see area ESf).

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it's contained in a moldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room. The chest is unlocked and not trapped.

E6. CEMETERY

A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.

During daytime, the cemetery is a still and peaceful place. Every night at midnight, however, a ghostly pro­ cession takes place (see "March of the Dead" below).

E7. HAUNTED HOUSE  
This haunted house is described in appendix B,

"Death House."

SPECIAL EVENTS

You can use one or both of the following special events while the characters explore the village.

MARCH OF THE DEAD

Every night at midnight, one hundred spirits rise from the cemetery (area E6) and march up the [[Old Svalich Road]] to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

An eerie green light suffuses the graveyard. From this light emerges a ghostly procession. Wavering images of doughty women toting greatswords, woodwise men with slender bows, dwarves with glittering axes, and archa­ ically dressed mages with beards and strange, pointed hats-all these and more march forth from the grave­ yard, their numbers growing by the second.

These aren't the spirits of the people buried here, but of previous adventurers who died trying to destroy [[Strahd]]. Every night, the ghostly adventurers attempt to complete their quest, and each night they fail. They have no inter­ est in the living and can't be hit, damaged, or turned. They will not communicate with the characters.

Once they reach the castle, the spirits march straight to the chapel (area KlS) and up the high tower stair (area K18) to the top of the tower (area K59). There, they throw themselves down the shaft toward the crypts (area K84), where they disappear.

DREAM PASTRIES

This event occurs as the characters make their way through the village.

You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure bundled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog.

Morgantha, a night hag in the guise of an old woman, has come to the village from [[Old Bonegrinder]] to sell her dream pastries for 1 gp apiece (see chapter 6 for a de­ scription of the pastries). She goes from house to house, knocking on doors. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, Morgantha tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday Barovian life. If the characters shadow her for a while, she collects payment from one household in the form of a seven-year-old boy named Lucianjarov (LG male human noncombatant). Lucian's parents plead with Morgantha not to take their boy, but she snatches the crying child from their grasp, stuffs him in a sack, straps him down to her peddler's cart, and casually makes her way back to [[Old Bonegrinder]].

Morgantha recognizes that the characters are strang­ ers and does her best to avoid them. If the characters demand the release of the child, she grudgingly com­ plies, knowing that she can always come back for the boy later. She fights only in self-defense and offers the following information in exchange for her life:

    [[Strahd]] has undead enemies in [[Barovia]], namely the fallen knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon. These revenants cart be found in a ruined mansion west of
    
    [[Vallaki]] (see chapter 7, "[[Argynvostholt]]").
