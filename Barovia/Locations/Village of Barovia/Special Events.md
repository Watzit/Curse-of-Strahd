SPECIAL EVENTS

You can use one or both of the following special events while the characters explore the village.

MARCH OF THE DEAD

Every night at midnight, one hundred spirits rise from the cemetery (area E6) and march up the [[Old Svalich Road]] to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

___________
"An eerie green light suffuses the graveyard. From this light emerges a ghostly procession. Wavering images of doughty women toting greatswords, woodwise men with slender bows, dwarves with glittering axes, and archaically dressed mages with beards and strange, pointed hats-all these and more march forth from the graveyard, their numbers growing by the second."
___________

These aren't the spirits of the people buried here, but of previous adventurers who died trying to destroy [[Strahd]]. Every night, the ghostly adventurers attempt to complete their quest, and each night they fail. They have no interest in the living and can't be hit, damaged, or turned. They will not communicate with the characters.

Once they reach the castle, the spirits march straight to the chapel (area KlS) and up the high tower stair (area K18) to the top of the tower (area K59). There, they throw themselves down the shaft toward the crypts (area K84), where they disappear.

DREAM PASTRIES

This event occurs as the characters make their way through the village.

___________
"You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure bundled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog."
___________

Morgantha, a night hag in the guise of an old woman, has come to the village from [[Old Bonegrinder]] to sell her dream pastries for 1 gp apiece (see chapter 6 for a de­ scription of the pastries). She goes from house to house, knocking on doors. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, Morgantha tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday Barovian life. If the characters shadow her for a while, she collects payment from one household in the form of a seven-year-old boy named Lucianjarov (LG male human noncombatant). Lucian's parents plead with Morgantha not to take their boy, but she snatches the crying child from their grasp, stuffs him in a sack, straps him down to her peddler's cart, and casually makes her way back to [[Old Bonegrinder]].

Morgantha recognizes that the characters are strang­ ers and does her best to avoid them. If the characters demand the release of the child, she grudgingly com­ plies, knowing that she can always come back for the boy later. She fights only in self-defense and offers the following information in exchange for her life:

-   Strahd has mastery over the land and the weather, and his spies include the Vistani.

-   There's a Vistani camp to the west, on the shores of Tser Pool (chapter 2, area G), and another on the outskirts of Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9).
- [[Strahd]] has undead enemies in [[Barovia]], namely the fallen knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon. These revenants cart be found in a ruined mansion west of [[Vallaki]] (see chapter 7, "[[Argynvostholt]]").
• [[Strahd]]'smostcarefullyguardedsecretisatempleof forbidden lore hidden in the mountains (see chapter 13, "[[The Amber Temple]]"). The temple can be reached by following the long and winding [[Tsolenka Pass]] (see chapter 9).
