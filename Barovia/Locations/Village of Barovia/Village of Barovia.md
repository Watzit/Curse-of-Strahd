The village of [[Barovia]] is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of [[Strahd]] that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], buried under fog but still unable to hide from the vampire's sight.

Until recently, [[Strahd]] had been paying nightly visits to lreena Kolyana, the adopted daughter of the village burgomaster. [[Ireena]] carries the soul of [[Strahd]]'s beloved [[Tatyana]] and looks exactly like her. [[Strahd]] intends to make [[Ireena]] his bride, turn her into a vampire, and lock her away in the castle crypts for all time.

APPROACHING THE VILLAGE

When the characters first approach the village, read:
________________________________________________
"Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds everything. T he muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognizable as village dwellings. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness. No sound cuts the silence except for mournful sobbing that echoes through the streets from a distance."
________________________________________________
The sobbing comes from [[Mad Mary's townhouse]] (area E3). With the exception of areas El and E2, all the shops in the village are permanently closed, and the unoccupied shops have been looted of anything valuable. Claw marks cover most of the walls.

When the fog eventually burns off, [[Castle Ravenloft]] looms over the village, like a lance piercing the sky.

HOUSE OCCUPANTS

If the characters explore a residence other than [[Mad Mary's townhouse]] (area E3) or the [[burgomaster's mansion]] (area E4), roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupants

OCCUPANTS OF HOUSES IN [[BAROVIA]]

| d20 | Occupants          |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 1-3 | None               |
| 4-8 | 2d4 swarms of rats |
|     |                    |

 None  
4-8 

9-16 Barovian villagers  
17-20 2d4 [[Strahd]] zombies (see appendix D)

RATS

A house infested with rats looks abandoned. The rats are servants of [[Strahd]] and attack if the characters ex足 plore the interior of the house.

BAROVIAN VILLAGERS

A house of Barovian villagers is home to ld4 adults (LG male and female human commoners) and ld8 - 1 chil足 dren (LG male and female noncombatants). Characters who listen at the door hear low, muffled whispers from within. These villagers aren't interested in speaking with strangers and never attack first, always fleeing from danger if possible. At night they cower by candle足 light and keep makeshift holy symbols close at hand.

[[STRAHD]] ZOMBIES

When the characters open a door or a shuttered win足 dow of a house infested with [[Strahd]] zombies, they are assailed by the stench of death. If the characters dare to enter, the zombies converge on their location.

Lying in the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], the village of [[Barovia]] is oppressed by fear. The villagers rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbours of wickedness and fearing evils are taking root in the shadows. Their fears are largely justified, as ghosts and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by their own callousness or wicked temptations. A rare exception to the village's cold desperation can be found at the local tavern called the Blood of the Vine. Those few who would oppose [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s evil congregate here and are in turn spied upon by the count's agents.
