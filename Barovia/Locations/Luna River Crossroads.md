Always check for a random encounter when the characters reach area P in their travels.

"The road comes to an X intersection, with branches to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The lower half of a snapped wooden signpost thrusts upward at an angle near the eastern elbow of the intersection. The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby."
________________________________________________

The characters can easily figure out how the top half of the signpost connects to the lower half. When the two parts of the sign are aligned and rejoined, the arms indi­ cate [[KREZK]] and [[Tsolenka Pass]] to the southwest, LAKE BARATOK to the northwest,[[Vallaki]] and [[RAVENLOFT]] to the northeast, and BEREZ to the southeast.

The [[Old Svalich Road]], which runs northeast to southwest between [[Vallaki]] (area N) and [[Krezk]] (area S), is generally level. About a quarter mile along the northeast branch, an arching stone bridge crosses the Luna River.

The northwest branch of the crossroads climbs gently, becoming a dirt trail through the woods within half a mile. It merges with the [[Old Svalich Road]] again after a couple of miles, but not before sprouting a branch that leads to [[Van Richten's Tower]] on Lake Baratok (area V). The southeast branch wends gently downward as it follows the river into a valley. This trail eventually ends at the mostly abandoned riverside burg of Berez (area U).
