Once a haven of virtuous wizards, the Amber Temple was long ago corrupted by evil. It was here that [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] made his pact with the [[Plane of Shadow/Domains of Dread/Dark Powers]] to become a vampire, with the blessing of the lich Exethanter. While the lich remains, albeit as a mere shadow of its former self, the true evil within the Amber Temple lies within its collection of amber sarcophagi. These monoliths hold vestiges of dead, hateful gods-beings that aspire to re-create past depravities and manipulate mortals to fulfill unspeakable agendas. Various evil forces set their intentions upon the Amber Temple, viewing it as a nexus of secrets underpinning the nature of the [[Domains of Dread]]. The priests of Osybus (detailed in the "Other Groups" section later in this chapter) have particular interest in this site.
