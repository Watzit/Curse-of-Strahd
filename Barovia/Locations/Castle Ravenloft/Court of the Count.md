Refer to map 4 of the castle for areas K25 through K34.

K25. AUDIENCE HALL
_____
"Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. This immense room is a place of chilly, brooding darkness. Empty iron sconces dot the walls. Hundreds of dust-laden cobwebs drape the hall, hiding the ceiling from view. Directly across from the window stand a set of double doors in the east wall. Farther south, a single door also leads from the east wall. Staircases at both ends of the north wall lead down.

At the far southern end of the hall, a large wooden throne stands atop a marble dais. The high-backed throne faces south, away from most of the room."
_____

A secret door in the south wall leads to area K13. It is hidden by dust and cobwebs, and requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. 

Both staircases in the north wall lead down to area Kl9. The eastern double doors can be pulled open to reveal area K26 beyond. The single door in the east wall opens into area K30.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the marble dais, just behind the throne.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is sitting on the wooden throne.

K26. GUARDS' POST

If the characters enter this hall through either set of double doors, read:

_____
"The doors open to reveal another set of double doors ten feet ahead, Between these doors, a ten-foot-wide corridor stretches north to south. At each end of the hall, floating in the darkness, is a human skeleton clad in the rusted armor and tattered livery of a castle guard."
_____

The "floating" skeletons hang from pegs on the north and south walls.The skeletons, which were assembled by Cyrus Belview (see area K62), are held together with wire and are harmless. Behind the skeleton on the north wall is a secret door that can be pushed open into area K33.

If the characters enter this hall by way of the secret door that adjoins area K33, they see the skeleton hanging on the inside of the secret door as soon as they pull it open, and, with a light source or darkvision, can see the skeleton at the south end of the hall as well.

K27. KING'S HALL
_____
"This twenty-foot-high hall has a dark, vaulted ceiling draped with cobwebs. A low moan seems to travel the length of the corridor as it rises and falls, intoning sadness and despair."
_____
The moaning is only the wind.
Characters who examine the ceiling can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, spot pulleys and a rope that run the full length of the corridor along the ceiling, well hidden by the cobwebs, These items are explained in "Flight of the Vampire" below.

Halfway down the hall on the south side is a narrow secret door that can be pulled open to reveal area K31.

FLIGHT OF THE VAMPIRE

Hidden in a compartment above the western set of double doors is a dressed wooden mannequin that looks exactly like [[Strahd]]. It wears a black cloak, its fangs are bared; and its arms and clawed fingers are outstretched in a threatening manner. The mannequin is attached to a role that runs" through pulleys fastened along the length of the hallway ceiling.

When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall from either direction, read:

____
"You hear a scraping sound of stone against stone, followed by the squeaking of a bat. In the direction of the noise, you see the fanged visage, outstretched claws, and flapping black cape of a vampire bearing down on you from above! A deep, throaty chuckle fills the hall."
____

The scraping noise is the sound of the hidden compartment opening, and the squeaking is the sound of the pulleys supporting the weight of the mannequin as it glides through the air. The chuckling is a harmless magical effect similar to that created by a prestidigitation cantrip.

Have the players roll initiative, and run this as a combat encounter with the "vampire" acting on initiative count 5. On its turn, the mannequin flies over the characters, 10 feet above the floor, and doesn't stop until it reaches the east end of the hall. On its next turn, it reverses direction and flies back to its compartment. The trap resets after 1 minute.

A character who attacks the mannequin from the floor needs a range of at least 10 feet. The mannequin has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the mannequin is reduced to 0 hit points while in the air, it falls to the floor.

K28. KING'S BALCONY
_____
"A sculpted stone railing encloses this long balcony, which overlooks Ravenloft's chapel. Two ornate thrones stand side by side in the center of the balcony, covered with dust and strung with cobwebs. The thrones face away from the double doors that give access to the balcony."
_____

Two [[Strahd]] zombies (see appendix D) are slouched on the thrones. They remain motionless until one of them is disturbed or another creature comes within a zom­ bie's reach, whereupon they attack.

The balcony is 50 feet above the floor of the chapel (area K15). A staircase north of the double doors leads down to area K29.

K29. CREAKY LANDING
____
"The staircase climbs from area K16 to area K28. It seems unstable but is sturdy. The creatures in area K28 can't be surprised by anyone climbing the creaky steps."
____

K30. KING'S ACCOUNTANT

Dusty scrolls and tomes line the walls of this room. More scrolls and books lie scattered on the floor, around four heavy wooden chests fitted with study iron locks. The only unobstructed floor space is directly in front of the doors on the east and west walls.

In the center of this clutter stands a great black desk.

A figure crouches atop a tall stool, scratching on a seem­ ingly endless scroll of paper with a dry quill pen. Nearby a tasseled rope hangs from a hole in the ceiling.

The figure is Lief Lipsiege (CE male human com­ moner), an accountant. He is chained to the heavy wooden desk and has no interest in the characters or their concerns. Under no circumstances does he voluntarily leave the room. Lief pulls the rope the instant he feels threatened.

Pulling the rope requires an action. When the rope is pulled, a tremendously loud gong sounds. One or more creatures arrive ld6 rounds later, attacking any charac­ ters still in the room. Determine the creatures randomly by rolling a d4:

d4 Creature

ld6 shadows

2.  2  ld4 vampire spawn
    
3.  3  ld4 wights
    
4.  4  l wraith and ld4 + l specters
    

Lief was pressed into service by [[Strahd]] many years ago. He keeps all the books for [[Strahd]], recording the vampire's riches and conquests. Lief has been here longer than he can remember. He is grumpy because [[Strahd]] doesn't allow him to know about all his trea­ sures. Even so, Lief has found out where one of [[Strahd]]'s secret treasures lies. If he is treated with kindness,

Lief will divulge the hiding place of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (see appendix C), as indicated by your card reading. Lief can draw a crude map showing a route to that location. His map is geographically accurate, but he admits that it doesn't acknowledge or avoid any dangers that might lie along the way. Lief doesn't necessarily know the most direct path to the symbol's location.

Lief knows that there's a key that unlocks all four chests, but he can't remember where he hid it. See "Treasure" below for more information.

The western door leads to area K25. The eastern

door provides access to a staircase (area K21) that leads down to area K9 and up to a landing outside area K35, continuing upward from there to area K47.

TREASURE

The room contains hundreds of worthless books and scrolls describing accounting procedures. The first character who spends at least 10 minutes searching the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Inves­ tigation) check finds a book with a bloodstained leather cover. The pages of this book have been hollowed out, creating a hole in which Lief has hidden the iron key that unlocks the four wooden chests in this room.

Two of the locked chests contain 10,000 cp each. A third chest contains 1,000 gp. The fourth chest holds 500 pp, hidden under which is a manual ofbodily health.

K31. TRAPWORKS

The aromas of grease and well-oiled wood hit your nos­ trils as you pull open the door. This ten-by-twenty-foot room is filled with intricate machinery, except for small spaces between the stone gears and the iron chains and pulleys. On the other side of the machinery, to the south, is a rectangular shaft that rises up from the darkness and continues past this room. Attached to the west wall is a steel plate that has an iron lever protruding downward.

See the diagram on page 76. The shaft (area K31a) de­ scends 90 feet from here to area K61, and ascends 40 feet to area K3lb. Another 40 feet above that is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into area K47.

Operating the machinery in this room raises a stone elevator compartment from the bottom of the shaft, l i f t ­ ing it past this room to the top of the shaft. See area K61 for more information on the elevator trap.

A character can spend 1 minute disabling the machin­ ery in this room. The elevator trap won't function until the machinery is repaired.

The iron lever set into the western wall is normally

in the "down" position. Moving it to the "up" position activates the trap and raises the elevator. Sliding it back down lowers the elevator and resets the trap.

When the elevator trap in area K61 is activated, all the chains, pulleys, and gears in this room move at once. It takes 10 seconds (1 round) for the elevator to reach the top of the shaft, and the machinery doesn't stop·until the elevator completes its journey.

A secret door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into area K27.

K31A. ELEVATOR SHAFT

Cold air fills this rectangular shaft, the walls of which are coated with mildew and worn smooth. Taut iron chains extend up and down the shaft. The links of the chains are thick and covered with grease.

The shaft is 170 feet tall. It starts at area K61, climbs 90 feet to area K31, another 40 feet to area K31b, and another 40 feet to area K47. When the elevator trap is activated (see areaK61 for details), a stone elevator compartment measuring 10 feet on a side rises up the western half of the shaft. At the same time, a solid block of stone, also 10 feet on a side, descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. Both stone blocks have thick iron chains bolted to them, by which they are hoisted and lowered them as needed.

Scaling the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber's kit, because the walls are smooth and slick with mildew, and the greasy iron chains are too thick and slippery to grasp.

Set into the roof of the shaft is a 5-foot-square stone trapdoor that can be pushed open to reveal areaK47.

K31B. SHAFT ACCESS

This ten-foot-square room overlooks a vertical shaft to the south that plunges into darkness and contin­ ues upward.

This vantage point is 130 feet from the bottom of the shaft (areaK31a). Forty feet down is areaK31, and 40 feet up is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into areaK47.

A door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into areaK39.

K32. MAID IN HELL

Oil lamps illuminate this long, rectangular chamber with oak-paneled walls. Stained, yellowed lace hangs neatly from eight canopied beds. The figure of a woman moves lithely about the room, dusting furniture and humming quietly. Around her pale, slender neck is a gold necklace with a ruby pendant.

The maid, Helga Ruvak, is a vampire spawn who claims to be the daughter of the village bootmaker, kid­ napped and forced into service by [[Strahd]]. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.

Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so onlyifshesensesanopportunityth_ atdoesn'tinvolve having to fight the entire party. �be also attacks if com- mandedtodosobyStrahd. . __ _ .

TREASURE
Helga's gold necklace with its ruby pendant is a gift from [[Strahd]]. The necklace is almost five centuries old and is worth 750 gp.

K33. KING'S APARTMENT STAIR

This dark hall is concealed behind two secret doors.

This arched corridor has been swept clean. Oak paneling decorates the walls to a height of four feet. Mounted on the east wall above the wood paneling are three unlit oil lamps spaced ten feet apart. A plain wooden door is set into the west wall, and light seeps through its cracks. A staircase at the north end of the west wall ascends into darkness.

The staircase climbs 40 feet to areaK45. The door in the west wall opens into areaK32.

K34. SERVANTS' UPPER FLOOR

Dirt-caked windows allow little light to enter this upstairs room. Broken bed frames and torn bits of mattress litter the floors. A tall, dusty wardrobe roughly shaped like a coffin, its black doors painted with fey creatures, stands between two cracked, full-length mirrors hanging on the

Isouth wall. A staircase descends along the north wall. I

If someone opens the wardrobe, read:

A plain white dress yellowed with age flies out of the wardrobe and begins to dance in the middle of the room. The dress flaps around to the music of the storm.

If anyone touches the dancing dress, it collapses in a lifeless heap on the floor. Otherwise, it dances forever. Hanging in the wardrobe are a few rotted servant's uni­ forms, none of which are animate or valuable.

Set into the south wall, behind the hanging mirror west of the wardrobe, is a secret door. It can be pulled open to reveal a closet choked with dust and cobwebs and that contains a wooden ladder that leads-up 20 feet to another secret door in the tower stairway (areaK20).

The staircase leads down to area K24.
