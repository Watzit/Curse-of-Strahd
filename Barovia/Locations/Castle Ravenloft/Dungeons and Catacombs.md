K73. DUNGEON HALL

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by way of the staircase to the east (area K21). Adjust as needed if the characters enter this hall from another direction.
_____
"The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water's surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the "thwick" of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door."
_____
The water is 3 feet deep in the hallway and opaque. 
The steps on both sides of the hallway descend another 2 feet before ending at the iron doors to the north and south.

The floor beneath the water isn't as solid as one might expect. There is a safe path around several weight- sensitive trapdoors (see the Traps in Area K73 diagram), but the water makes it impossible to see where the trapdoors are. For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trapdoor opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trapdoor when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.

When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens).  

The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn't open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.

Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).

K74. NORTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.
_____
"A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. One of the cells is dimly lit."
_____
The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. Light spills out of cell K74h.

A hinged door made up of 1-inch-thick rusted iron bars spaced 4 inches apart, with horizontal crossbars spaced 6 inches apart, closes off each cell. Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.

A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.

[[Strahd]] visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here. He can enter a cell by entering mist form.

K74A . FORGOTTEN TREASURE.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73: Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K74E. END OFTHE RIDE

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in are.a K73.

Secret Door. A secret door is:s fe.et up from the floor on the north wall of this cell. The secret door can't be opened from this side without.the use of a knock spell or similar magic. Behind the secret door 1s a chute of polished black marble that slants upward (area K82).

K74F. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K74G. GRAY OOZE

K74H. LOST SWORD
____
"A glowing blade can be seen beneath the water near the back of the cell."
____
This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.

Treasure. The source of the underwater glow is a sentient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

- The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.

- A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.  
  
- While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the crusader's mantle spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.

K75. SOUTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.
_____
"A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. From one of the cells, you hear a gruff voice ask, "Who's there?""
_____
The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. The voice comes from one of the southernmost cells (area K75a).

K75A. PRISONER
____
"A strong young man clutches the bars of his cell while struggling to keep his teeth from chattering. His clothes are shredded, and he is soaked from head to toe."
____
The man is Emil Toranescu, a werewolf with 72 hit points. He claims to be a resident of [[Vallaki]] who was chased by dire wolves to the castle. He begs the characters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.

In truth, [[Strahd]] locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his werewolf pack (see chapter 15). Anxious to prove his worth to [[Strahd]], Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn't turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika (see chapter 15, area Z7). In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the characters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.

K75B. FORGOTTEN TREASURE

Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.

Treasure. Scattered across the floor of this cell are 2,100 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of [[Strahd]] von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.

K75c. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75D. DEAD DWARF

K75e. EMPTY CELL
This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75F. DEAD WIZARD
_____
"Shackled to the back wall of this cell is an emaciated figure in a blue robe, its spindly arms spread wide and its head tilted forward. Long, gray hair hangs down in front of the dead man's face."
_____
The skeletal figure is all that remains of a human wizard whom [[Strahd]] captured and slowly bled to death. Flesh still clings to the wizard's bones, and puncture marks from the vampire's fangs are visible on the wizard's neck.

K75G. HANGING BARD
____
"Pounded into the roof of this cell is a rusted iron pulley, strung through which is a rope that is tied to one of the crossbeams of the barred door. Dangling upside down from the pulley is a man, flabby and stout of build, in tight-fitting leather armor. His boots are bound with rope just below the pulley, his fleshy hands are tied behind his back, and his head is underwater. He isn't moving."
____
[[Strahd]] had this human bard suspended from the ceiling as a test to see how long he could keep his head above water. The man weakened and drowned. On the floor of the cell, below the hanging corpse, is a smashed lyre.

K75H. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K76. TORTURE CHAMBER
____
"Dark, low shapes thrust up out of the still, brackish water that fills this fifty-foot-square room, the ceiling of which is festooned with hanging chains that look like thick, black web strands. A balcony set into the north wall overlooks the room and has two large thrones atop it, with a red velvet curtain behind them."
____
The ceiling is 17 feet above the surface of the water, which is 3 feet deep. The balcony to the north stands 7 feet above the water's surface, 10 feet above the floor.
If the characters approach the "dark, low shapes" in the water read:
____
"The dark shapes in the water are racks, iron maidens, stocks, and other instruments of torture. The skeletons of their last victims lie within them, their jaws seemingly frozen open in silent screams."
____
As soon as one or more characters move more than 10 feet into the room, six [[Strahd]] zombies rise slowly out of the water, their slime-gray arms clawing upward through the water as they attack.

K77. OBSERVATION BALCONY ·
____
"Two large, wooden thrones rest on this balcony. Behind the thrones hangs a red velvet curtain thirty feet long. The ceiling here is ten feet high."
____
The room continues behind the curtain an additional 10 feet to a wall that has a door in its center.

K78. BRAZIER ROOM
____
"This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat. The rim of the brazier is carved with seven cup-shaped indentations spaced evenly around the circumference. Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.

Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.

Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep alcoves facing each other. The brazier sits between them."
____
The two statues are iron golems. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circumstances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the "Development" section that follows).

The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the hourglass is-reduced to 0 hit points, its glass shatters, causing the sand within it to fall to the floor. The magic writing on the base of the hourglass reads as follows:

Cast a stone into the fire:
Violet leads to the mountain spire
Orange to the castle's peak
Red if lore is what you seek
Green to where the coffins hide
Indigo to the master's bride
Blue to ancient magic's womb
Yellow to the master's tomb.

The braziers flame is magical and sheds no warmth. A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) extinguishes the flame for 1 hour. The fire is permanently extinguished if the brazier is destroyed. The brazier has AC 17, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage.

The stones set into the brazier's rim are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, respectively. Tossing one into the brazier causes its flame to change from white to the color of the stone, and the sand begins falling through the hourglass. Any creature that touches the colored flame is teleported to a location within [[Strahd]]'s domain, as determined by the color:

| Flame Color | Teleports to ... |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Red         | Study (area K37)            |
| Orange      | North tower peak (area K60)            |
| Yellow      | [[Strahd]]'s tomb (area K86)                |
| Green       | Coffin maker's shop (chapter 5, area N6f)             |
| Blue        | Amber Temple (chapter 13, area X42)              |
| Indigo      | [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] (chapter 8, area S17)              |
| Violet      | [[Tsolenka Pass]] (chapter 9, area T4)                 |

After 5 rounds, the sand runs out, and the color of the flame returns to white. When the flame does so, the sand instantly reappears in the top part of the hourglass (provided the hourglass is intact), and the stone that was cast into the fire reappears in the brazier's rim.

DEVELOPMENT

If the brazier, the hourglass, or either golem is attacked, the doors of the room magically slam shut and lock (unless they are being held or wedged open), and the golems animate and attack. On the first round, the golems fill the room with their poison breath, which issues from the horses' mouths. (Each creature in the room must make two saving throws, one for each breath weapon.) On subsequent rounds, each golem makes one attack with its sword and one slam attack with its hoof. When there are no creatures left to fight in the room, the golems return to their alcoves, and the doors unlock. Forcing open a locked door requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door has AC 15, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

K79. WESTERN STAIR
_____
"This staircase of ancient stone is worn smooth. Thick dust covers its steps, and cobwebs choke the passage."
_____
The stairs rise at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 40 feet horizontally, leading to a 10 foot square landing (see below). A second set of stairs continues upward to the east at a similar angle for a distance of 30 feet horizontally, ending at a secret door that opens into area K72.

LANDING
Inscribed on the landing, hidden 'under years of dust, is a glyph of warding. If the characters brush away the dust, someone can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

The glyph triggers the first time a living creature passes over it. Triggering it activates a major image spell, conjuring an illusion of [[Strahd]] von Zarovich that appears either halfway up the stairs leading to area K72 or halfway down the stairs leading to area K78, so that the vampire appears in front of the triggering character. When "[[Strahd]]" appears, read:

A sickly mist fills the stairway ahead, then coalesces into the form of the vampire [[Strahd]], his eyes burning red with anger. "You have worn out your welcome," he says. "Whatever gods you believe in cannot save you now!"

Have the characters roll initiative. Any attack or spell that hits "[[Strahd]]" passes through, revealing that he is an illusion. On initiative count 0, the illusory vampire chuckles and melts away like a wax doll in a bonfire, leaving no trace behind, and the glyph disappears.

K80. CENTER STAIR  
If the characters enter this area through the door at the bottom of the stairs read:
____
"The door creaks open to reveal a stone staircase between rough masonry walls. There is little dust on the steps, but light fog tumbles down the steps from above."
____
If the characters enter this area at the top of the staircase, read:
____
"The rough-hewn corridor ends at a stone staircase that descends to the south. Flanked by walls of rough masonry and relatively free of dust, these stairs descend before ending at a lonely door."
____
The stairs slope at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 20 feet horizontally, connecting areas K78 and K81.

K81. TUNNEL
____
"This tunnel is cut into the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]] itself. Its surface is slick, and its ceiling is barely 6 feet high. A lingering fog limits visibility to a few feet."
____

Characters who have knowledge of stonecutting can tell that this passage is a relatively pew construction compared to other areas of Ravenloft. The tunnel is 120 feet long, with a stone door at its eastern end.

Near the midpoint of the tunnel is a trapdoor hidden under a layer of fog. Characters can't spot the trapdoor passively, but active search accompanied by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check locates it. Unless the trapdoor is fastened shut with an iron spike or by some other means, it opens when 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on it. When the trapdoor opens, everyone who is standing on it slides into the marble chute below (area K82). The trapdoor then resets.

K82. MARBLE SLIDE

If one or more characters fall through the trapdoor in area K81, read:
_____
"You fall into a chute of polished black marble slide into the darkness"
_____
The chute plunges from the trapdoor in area K81 through a one-way secret door into a flooded cell (area K74e). Characters who slide all the way to the bottom are deposited in the cell, but take no damage. The slide contains no handholds and is too slippery to ascend without the aid of magic.

K83. SPIRAL STAIR
_____
"Behind the door lies a dark spiral staircase."
_____
The staircase starts at area K78, climbs to a landing at area K83a, and continues upward to area K37.

K83A. SPIRAL STAIR LANDING

An extension of area K83, this landing is shown on map 11.
____
"This forty-foot-long corridor connects two spiral stairways, one leading up and the other descending into the depths of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Hanging from an iron rod bolted to the eastern wall is a dusty, ten-foot-square tapestry depicting knights on horseback charging across a battlefield under a blood red sky. The lead knight rides a black horse and wears a fur-lined black cloak, dark gray armor, and a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. His sword glows with the light of the sun."
____
The stairs at the nor.th end of the west wall descends to a door leading to area K78. The stairs at the south end of the west wall lead up, ending at door that opens into area K37.

TREASURE

The tapestry depicts [[Strahd]]'s father, King Barov, leading his fearsome knights into.glorious battle. The tapestry weighs 10 pounds arid is worth 750 gp intact. If it becomes damaged while in the party's possession it is worthless unless mended.

K84. CATACOMBS
_____
"Buried deep beneath the keep of Ravenloft lie ancient catacombs, with arched ceilings supported by wide, hollow columns that double as crypts. Cobwebs hang limp in the musty air. A thick fog clings to the floor, which is covered in putrid waste. The black ceiling is moving."
_____
The catacombs fill an area roughly 110 feet east to west by 180 feet north to south, and the floor is covered in several inches of bat guano. The catacombs are made up of 10-foot-wide arched walkways running between 10-foot-square crypts, which serve as pillars that support the 20-foot-high ceiling. The area has five means of entry and exit:

- The door adjacent to crypt 1 (connecting with area K81)

- A barred archway to the north (connecting with area K85)

- A barred archway to the south (connecting with area K86 but warded by teleport traps)

- The high tower stair (areaK18) or the shaft(area K18a) to the west

- A barred archway to the east (connecting with area K87)

Each crypt is sealed with a chiseled stone "door"-actually a tight-fitting stone slab measuring 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 3 inches thick. Removing or resetting a stone slab requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Each crypt houses the remains of the person or persons whose epitaph is inscribed on the front of the slab. The crypts are described in the following sections, their epitaphs noted under the crypt's number in italics.

Unless noted otherwise, each crypt contains a 3-foot by-6-foot rectangular bier of marble, 3 feet high, with a skeleton draped in rags lying atop it.

The catacombs are home to tens of thousands of bats.

The bats hang here during daytime hours and fly out in the evening through the high tower's central shaft (area K18a) to hunt at night. They will not attack intruders unless they are provoked or are specifically commanded to do so by [[Strahd]]. If one or more bats within a 10-foot square on the map are attacked or caught in the area of a harmful spell, 2d4 swarms of bats form in that area and attack. No more swarms can be formed in that square until the next dawn, when more bats arrive to replenish those that were killed.

TELEPORT TRAPS

Invisible teleport traps are located between crypts 37 and 38, between crypt 37 and the wall south of it, and between crypt 38 and the wall south of it. The traps can't be perceived except with a detect magic spell, which reveals an aura of conjuration magic in the trapped areas. Although the traps can't be disarmed, a successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) on a trap suppresses its magic for 1 minute, allowing characters to move safely through its area. A trap is also suppressed while wholly or partly in the area of an antimagic field.

These teleport traps form a protective ring around the entrance to [[Strahd]]'s tomb (area K86). Any creature that enters one of these 10-foot-square spaces is instantly teleported away, switching places with one of the wights in crypt 14. The wight materializes in the creature's previous location and attacks any living creature it sees.

CRYPT 1
____
"Herein lie the ones who walk the path of pain and torment"
____
The stone door connects not with a crypt, but with a hewn tunnel of stone (area K81).

CRYPT2
____
Artista DeSlop - Court Ceiling Painter  

"The domed ceiling of this crypt is painted with an image of imps holding bouquets of colorful flowers. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. A wooden box is tucked under one bony hand."
____
The box is unlocked. It contains seven wood-handled paintbrushes and seven small gourds of dried-up paint.

CRYPT 3  
Lady Isolde Yunk (Isolde the Incredible): Purveyor of antiques and imports
____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Piled all around it, covering the floor, are heaps of old baskets, braziers, bundled tapestries, candlesticks, chairs, chests, cooking utensils, cressets, curtain rods, decanters, dishes, jugs, lamps, scroll cases, tankards, and tinderboxes. None of the junk looks valuable. An old chandelier hangs from the domed ceiling."
____
Characters could spend hours searching the crypt. Though the antiques here might fetch a fair amount of coin, they are hardly worth the trouble to transport.

CRYPT 4
Prince Ariel du Plumette (Ariel the Heavy)  
If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:
____
"The apparition of a large, rotund man forms within the dark crypt, its eyes wild with insanity. Large, artificial wings unfold from its back."
____
Prince Ariel was a terrible man who longed to fly. He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn't bear his weight, and he plunged from the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]] to his death. His evil ghost attacks the characters on sight. If Ariel succeeds in possessing a character, his host climbs the high tower (area K18) until it reaches the peak (area K59), then hurls itself down the tower's central shaft (area K18a), screaming, "I can fly!" the whole way down.

CRYPT 5
_____
Artank Swilovich: Friend and member ofthe Barovian Wine Distillers Guild

"You are greeted by the faint smell of wine. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Heaped around it, covering the entire floor, are thousands of empty wine bottles."
_____
Each bottle's label shows that it is from [[the Wizard of Wines]] winery, and the label names the wine inside: Champagne du le Stomp, Red Dragon Crush, or Purple Grapemash No. 3.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried under the wine bottles. A character who searches under the bottles finds the treasure automatically.

CRYPT 6

Saint Markovia: Dead for all time

The 10-foot-square section of floor in front of this crypt is a pressure plate that releases four poison darts hidden in tiny holes in the north wall. (See "Sample Traps" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the rules on how this trap functions.) The trap resets when the weight is lifted and can be triggered a total of four times before its supply of darts is depleted.

If the door to the crypt is opened, read:
____
"This crypt smells of roses. The remains atop its marble slab have disintegrated, except for one thighbone."
____
If the characters disturb Saint Markovia's remains, add: 
____
"A ghostly form appears above the dust, so faint that you can barely discern more than part of a face. From this apparition comes the faintest of whispers: "The vampire must be destroyed. Use me as your weapon." With that, it fades away."
____
Treasure
A detect magic spell reveals that the thighbone radiates an aura of evocation magic. See appendix C for more information on Saint Markovia's thighbone.

CRYPT 7
_____
"The stone door of this crypt lies on the floor, its inscription obscured by fog. The crypt gapes open. A skull, some bones, and a few bits of rusted armor lie atop a marble slab with a leering stone gargoyle squatting at each end."
_____
The epitaph on the door reads "Endorovich (Endorovich the Terrible): What the blood of a hundred wars did not do, the spurn of a woman accomplished."
Endorovich was a ruthless soldier and self-aggrandising noble who loved a woman named Marya but she lobed another man. As Marya and her lover were dining, Endorovich put poison into the man's wineglass. The glases, however, were mixed up, and Marya drank the poison intended for her lover instead. The lover was hanged for murdering Marya and buried at the Ivlis River crossroads. Endorovich never got over his guilt and, out of madness, killed many in his lifetime.
Endorovich's spirit is trapped inside one of his gargoyles. If anyone disturbs the bones on the slab, one  
of the gargoyles awakens and attacks. If the gargoyle is reduced to O hit points, Endorovich's spirit moves to the second gargoyle, which then awakens and attacks. Both gargoyles have maximum hit points (77 ). Once the second gargoyle is destroyed, Endorovich's spirit is laid to rest.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is contained in a secret compartment under Endorovich's remains. Once his bones and dust are swept away, the compartment can be found and opened without an ability check.

CRYPT 8

Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya
_____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Hanging on the back wall is a handsome quilt that depicts a royal feast."
_____
The quilt is magically preserved but not valuable.

CRYPT 9
Pidlwick - Fool of Dorfniya
____
"A small skeleton wearing the remains of a fool's costume lies atop a stumpy marble slab in the center of the crypt."
____
If Pidlwick II (see area K59) is with the party, it refuses to enter the crypt. The slab in this crypt is 4 feet long (instead of the usual 6 feet long) The bones atop the slab belong to the fool servant of Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya (see crypt 8).

Treasure. If the characters explore this crypt after summoning the ghost of Pidlwick in area K36, they find a small, flat wooden box on the marble slab next to Pidlwick's bones. The box contains a full deck of illusions.

Crypt 10
Sir Leonid Krushkin (Sir Lee the Crusher): Bigger than life, he loved his jewelry
____
"An oversized skeleton draped in jewelry and rags lies atop an elongated marble slab in the center of the crypt. Leaning against the slab is a bloodstained maul strung with cobwebs."
____
Sir Lee stood well over seven feet tall. His maul might give the characters pause, but it is harmless and nonmagical.

TREASURE
Three jeweled necklaces (worth 750 gp each) are lying across Sir Lee's skeleton.

CRYPT 11

Tasha Petrovna - Healer of Kings, Light unto the West, Servant, Companion
____
"A skeleton wearing tattered priestly vestments lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The domed ceiling overhead is painted with a glorious sun mural."
____
Creatures that would take damage from exposure to sunlight (such as vampires) have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws while inside this crypt.

**Treasure**. Draped around the neck of the skeleton is a sun-shaped holy symbol (worth 25 gp). A good-aligned character who picks up the holy symbol hears a ghostly female voice. It whispers the following message
____
"There is a grave to the west, with roses that never die, in a place built by healers, in a village called [[Krezk]]. When all turns to darkness, touch this holy symbol to the grave to summon the light and find a treasure long lost."
____
The message refers to a gravestone in the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]]

CRYPT 12
King Troisky - The Three Faced King
____
"There are no bones atop the marble slab in this crypt, only a steel helm with a visor shaped line an angry face."
____
The helm has three evenly spaced visors crafted to look like human faces - one sad, one happy, and one angry. Only the angry visage is visible from the crypt's doorway. King Troisky wore this three helm in battle, earning him the moniker of Three-Faced King. The helm is nonmagical and weighs 10 pounds.

The slab upon which the helm rests is weight-sensitive. If the helm is removed from the slab without 10 pounds of weight immediately being added, poisonous gas pours out of the slab's hollow interior and fills the crypt. A character who searches the slab for traps and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check spots tiny holes bored into the slab's marble base. It's from these holes that the gas spews forth.

A creature in the crypt when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

CRYPT 13

King Katsky (Katsky the Bright): Ruler, inventor, and self-proclaimed time traveler
____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Lying amid the bones is a stoppered drinking horn, a fat pouch, and a weird-looking scepter made of metal and wood. Above the bones, hanging from the domed ceiling by wires, is a wooden flying contraption that looks like a set of folding dragon wings fitted with leather straps, metal buckles, and taut leather wing flaps."
____
The stoppered drinking horn is a water-resistant powder horn loaded with gunpowder, and the "weird-looking scepter" is a musket. The fat pouch contains 20 silver marbles (silvered bullets for the musket). For more information on firearms and explosives, see chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop," of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Glider. Any Small or Medium humanoid can wear the dragon-wing glider. (It takes 1 minute to don or doff the glider.) It can't support more than 80 pounds, although the amount of weight it can carry is not evident. A character who inspects the glider in an attempt to discern its maximum weight allowance can do so accurately with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.

If its wearer is light enough (accounting for gear), the apparatus can be used to glide, but only in wide-open spaces where there is room to manoeuvre. The wearer can become airborne by stepping or jumping off a high place, or by performing a high jump to take off from level ground. While aloft, the wearer gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, with the following limitations: except in a significant updraft the wearer can't use the glider to gain altitude, 
 and the glider descends 1 foot for every 10 feet of horizontal distance covered. At the end of the flight, the wearer lands on its feet and the glider is intact. If the wearer tries to accelerate the rate of descent, the glider breaks, and the wearer falls.

The glider has AC 12, 1 hit point, and a 15-foot wingspan. Any damage causes it to break and become inoperable. A mending cantrip can repair the damage, provided all the broken pieces are present.

CRYPT 14

Stahbal Indi-Bhak: A truer friend no ruler ever had. Here lies his family in honor.

If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:
____
"A ten-foot-square shaft plunges into darkness. The sound of slowly dripping water echoes up the shaft."
____
Characters who have darkvision or a sufficient light source can see that the shaft descends 40 feet to some kind of vault deep in the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]]. Stones protrude from the shaft at regular intervals, offering handholds and footholds. The stones are slippery, however, so a character who tries to scale the wall without the aid of magic or the use of a climber's kit must make a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

Vault. When the characters reach the bottom of the shaft, read:
____
"At the bottom of the shaft is a dank vault with a ten-foot high ceiling. The room is awkwardly shaped and smells of rotten meat. Fifteen stone coffins are scattered throughout the vault, all oriented with their heads pointed north. The floor is covered with human bones and rusty swords."
____
If a character teleports into a coffin from one of the tele, port traps that protect [[Strahd]]'s tomb (area K86), read the following to that character's player:
____
"A flash of light explodes around you, and then you are plunged into absolute darkness, suddenly lying in a confined space choked with dust."
____
This vault contains fifteen wights (one per coffin), minus any that have been teleported away (see "Teleport Traps" at the start of this section). Lifting a coffin's lid requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Each wight remains inactive until it is teleported away or until its coffin is opened, whereupon it attacks.

The bones and rusty swords cover the floor to a depth of 6 inches, and are the remains of servants who swore to avenge Stahbal Indi-Bhak's family. Whenever a wight is killed in this vault, some of the bones knit together, forming 2d6 animated human skeletons. These skeletons attack intruders on sight but have no ranged attacks. There are enough bones and swords in the room for one hundred skeletons to form in this manner.

CRYPT 15

Khazan: His word was power
____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The skull has black opals set in its eye sockets and shards of amber where its teeth should be."
____
Khazan was a powerful archmage who unlocked the secrets of lichdom, then later tried to become a demilich and failed. Neither his skull nor his bones pose any threat, but the gems embedded in the skull are valuable.

Treasure. The skull's black opal eye-gems are worth 1,000 gp apiece. The skull also has eight amber teeth worth 100 gp each.

Any creature that stands inside the crypt and boldly speaks the name "Khazan" causes the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]] to tremble as a staff of power materializes above the marble slab and hovers in place. The first creature to grab hold of the staff must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, the staffof power can be held and used normally. If no one grabs the staff within 1 round of its appearance, it vanishes, never to return.

CRYPT 16  
Elsa Fallona von Twitterberg (Beloved Actor): She had many followers
_____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the· center of the crypt. Nine shallow alcoves are carved into the surrounding walls. The back wall of each alcove is painted with a full-body image of a handsome man. Some of the men wear fine clothes; others wear armor. At the feet of each painting rests a skull atop a pile of bones."
_____
The bones in the niches belong to Elsa's nine consorts. There is nothing of value here.

CRYPT 17

Sir Sedrik Spinwitovich (Admiral Spinwitovich): Con­ fused though he was, he built the greatest naval force ever assembled in a landlocked country
____
"An eleven-foot-long funeral barge dominates this crypt, wedged diagonally into the available space. Lying in the boat is a skeleton draped in rags, with hundreds of gold coins piled around it."
____
The coins are made of clay painted gold and are worthless. The funeral barge, which was assembled inside the crypt, is too big to fit through the door.

CRYPT 18

The stone door of this crypt has been carefully laid to one side. Through the swirly mists of the perpetual fog, freshly engraved letters spell out the words "[[Ireena]] Kolyana: Wife."

The crypt is empty and has been swept clean. This is where [[Strahd]] intends to keep [[Ireena]] once he turns her into a vampire spawn

CRYPT 19  
Artimus (Builder of the Keep): T hou standest amidst the monument to his life
_____
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. "
_____
This crypt contains nothing of interest.

CRYPT 20

Sasha Ivliskova - Wife
_____
"Webs as thick and pale as linen cover a shapely female form lying atop a marble slab in the center of this dusty, web-filled crypt. You hear a voice issue from the darkness.

"My love, have you come to set me free?"

The woman rises, the shroud of webs clinging to her in a ghastly fashion."
_____
This vampire spawn is an old wife of [[Strahd]]'s. Once she realizes that the characters aren't her husband, Sasha tears away her web shroud like an unloved wedding dress and attacks.

CRYPT 21  
Patrina Velikovna - Bride

The creature inside this crypt attacks as soon as the door is opened.
_____
"From the darkness comes a horrifying visage, a spectral elf maiden twisted by the horror of her undead existence. She wails, and the very sound claws at your soul."
_____
The spectral elf is a banshee that attacks the characters on sight, using her wail immediately. Once awakened, the banshee is free to roam [[Castle Ravenloft]], but she can't travel more than 5 miles from this crypt.

In life, Patrina Velikovna was a dusk elf who, having learned a great deal about the black arts, was nearly a match for [[Strahd]]'s powers. She felt a great bond with him and asked to solemnize that bond in a dark marriage. Drawn to her knowledge and power, [[Strahd]] consented, but before he could drain all life from Patrina, her own people stoned her to death in an act of mercy to thwart [[Strahd]]'s plans. [[Strahd]] demanded, and got, Patrina's body. She then became the banshee trapped here.

Reducing the banshee to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate. Patrina's spirit can't rest however, until she is formally wed to [[Strahd]]; the banshee re-forms in her crypt 24 hours later. Casting a hallow spell on the crypt prevents the banshee from returning for as long as the spell lasts.

Treasure. Read the following text when the characters investigate Patrina's crypt: 
____
"In the center of the crypt, a skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab, surrounded by thousands of coins."
____
Patrina's crypt contains 250 pp, 1,100 gp, 2,300 ep, 5,200 sp, and 8,000 cp. The coins are of a mixed origin. The platinum and electrum coins have [[Strahd]]'s profiled visage stamped on them. Buried under the coins is Patrina's spellbook, which has carved wooden covers. It contains all the spells listed for the archmage in the Monster Manual.

Development. If she is restored to life by her brother (see "Kasimir's Dark Gift" in the "Special Events" section in chapter 13), Patrina (NE female dusk elf) returns as an archmage with no spells prepared. If the characters have her spellbook, she kindly asks them to give it back to her so that she can prepare her long-forgotten spells and help destroy [[Strahd]] (a lie). If the characters oblige, she repays their kindness by learning as much about them as.possible before pursuing her own goals.

CRYPT 22

Sir Erik Vonderbucks
___
"A gilded man lies atop a marble slab in the center of this otherwise barren crypt."
___
Sir Erik Vonderbucks was a wealthy noble whose dying wish was to have his corpse dipped in molten gold.

Treasure. The thin layer of gold, if peeled from Sir Erik's desiccated corpse, is worth 500 gp.

CRYPT 23

The first time the characters happen upon this crypt, they see one of their names (determined randomly) etched into the door. Opening the crypt releases a horrid stench of decay and reveals a corpse lying on the marble slab within. The corpse looks like the character named on the door. Touching the corpse causes it to melt away, whereupon the inscription fades. On later visits to this crypt, the door is unmarked and the crypt is empty.

CRYPT 24
Ivan lvliskovich, Champion of Winter Dog Racing: The race may go to the swift, but vengeance is for the loser's relatives

A skeleton draped in bits of fur lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The walls and ceiling are covered with plaster painted to make the crypt seem as if it stands in an evergreen forest, surrounded by snow. The plaster has peeled and fallen away in many places, shattering the illusion.

This crypt contains nothing of interest

CRYPT 25

Stefan Gregorovich: First Counselor to King Barov van Zarovich
___
"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Most of the bones appear dusty and neglected, but the skull is well polished."
___
A detect magic spell cast here reveals that Stefan's skull radiates a faint aura of necromancy magic. As long as the skull remains in the crypt, it will answer up to five questions put to it, as though a speak with dead spell had been cast on it. This property recharges each day at dawn. In life, Stefan was neither observant nor well in­ formed. If the skull is questioned about [[Strahd]] or [[Castle Ravenloft]], all the information it provides is untrue.

CRYPT 26

"A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Most of the bones appear dusty and neglected, but the skull is well polished."
_____
A detect magic spell cast here reveals that Stefan's skull radiates a faint aura of necromancy magic. As long as the skull remains in the crypt, it will answer up to five questions put to it, as though a speak with dead spell had been cast on it. This property recharges each day at dawn. Unlike Stefan Gregorovich in crypt 25, Intree was well educated and astute. If the skull is questioned about [[Strahd]] or the castle, the information it provides is true.

CRYPT 27

"This crypt is missing its door."

Three giant wolf spiders infest this otherwise empty crypt. The spiders make no noise and leap out to attack anyone who moves in front of the crypt's gap- ing doorway.

CRYPT 28.  
Bascal Ofenheiss - Chef Deluxe

"A skeleton draped in white linen lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt, clutching a bell to its sunken chest. Fitted over its skull is a tall chef's hat."

If the beII is rung insidet4e c}yp/�agic fire sweeps through th�· crypt to search Chef Ofenheiss's bones. A c(eatμre iv. .the.cryptmust make a DC 17 Dexterity sav- · ing throw, taking 2i (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, br h�lf·�arrn1ge .9n a successful one. Any creature that fails its save catches fire, taking 5 (ldlO) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it or another creature uses an action to douse the flames.

Treasure. Tucked under the chef's hat is an electrum spork with a bejeweled handle (worth 250 gp).

CRYPT 29  
Baron Eisglaze Driif

Opening the door causes the air around you to turn as cold as the coldest hell you can imagine. Every surface inside the crypt is covered with thick, brownish mold.

A patch of brown mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide) fills the crypt. Characters within 5 feet of the crypt's open doorway are affected.

If the brown mold is killed off, characters can dig through the moldy crust to find the bones of Baron Driif lying atop a marble slab.

Treasure. Hidden under the brown mold next to the baron's bones is a luck blade with one wish remaining. If a creature uses the wish to try to escape from [[Barovia]], the spell fails. If a creature uses the sword to wish for [[Strahd]]'s destruction, the wish doesn't destroy [[Strahd]] but rather teleports him to within 5 feet of the sword.

CRYPT 30

Prefect Ciril Romulich (Beloved of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia): High Priest of the Most Holy Order

A marble slab in the center of the crypt displays a skel­ eton draped in red vestments, a golden holy symbol clutched in one bony hand. The domed ceiling fifteen feet above is painted to look like a canopy of trees with bright autumn leaves. A narrow stone ledge encircles the crypt ten feet above the floor. Perched on it are dozens of stone ravens, their eyes fixed on the marble slab.

The carved ravens are ominous yet harmless.

Treasure. The prefect's gold holy symbol is festooned with tiny gemstones and is worth 750 gp. If touched by an evil creature, the holy symbol is consumed in a blast of intense light that deals 11 (2d10) radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Characters familiar with Barovian religion recognize the symbol as that of the Morninglord.

lCRYPT 31 l We knew him onlybyhis wealth

This crypt is empty. Its walls are painted to depict moun­ tains of gold coins.

The floor of the crypt is actually the cover of a 30-foot­ deep spiked pit. The cover opens if 100 pounds of weight or more are placed on it. It splits down the mid­ dle, east to west, and its doors are spring-loaded. After  
a victim or victims fall into the pit, its doors snap shut. (See "Sample Traps" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environ­ ments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the rules on locking pits and spiked pits.) The spikes at the bottom of the pit are made of iron but aren't poisoned.

Treasure. A human skeleton (the remains of a dead adventurer) wrapped in bits of studded leather armor lies amid the spikes at the bottom of the pit. A ·shattered lantern and a rusty crowbar lie nearby. Tied to the corpse's leather belt is a SO-foot coil of hempen rope, a dagger in a worn scabbard, a pouch containing 25 pp, and a stoppered wooden tube containing a spell scroll of magic circle.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying next to the skeleton at the bottom of the pit.

CRYPT 32

The door to this crypt has no name or epitaph on it.

This crypt is empty except for two alcoves in the back wall. Above the alcoves are carved the following words: PASS Nor THESE PORTALS YE FOOLISH MORTALS

A detect magic spell reveals that both alcoves radiate strong auras of conjuration magic.

Creatures that enter the eastern alcove of this crypt are teleported to the eastern alcove of [[Strahd]]'s tomb (area K86). Stepping into the western alcove of this crypt has no effect, but any creature that teleports from the western alcove of area K86 appears here.

CRYPT 33

Sir Klutz Tripalotsky: He fell on his own sword

In the center of this crypt, atop a marble slab, human bones lie amid the empty shell of a suit of rusty plate armor. Plunged through the armor's breastplate is a longsword.

Neither Sir Klutz's armor nor his longsword are magical or valuable.

If the sword is pulled from the armor, Sir Klutz ap­ pears as a phantom warrior (see appendix D), thanks whoever pulled his weapon free, ?nd agrees to fight alongside that character for the next seven days. Sir

CRYPT 34

King Dostron the Hellborn

Resting in the center of this crypt is a seven-foot-long gilded sarcophagus, its lid painted with the likeness of a screaming king wearing a crown of horns. Looming behind the sarcophagus is a stuffed owlbear frozen in a roar, with claws outstretched.

King Dostron was an ancient ruler of this land, long before the arrival of [[Strahd]]. He claimed descent from a duke of the Nine Hells, and his deeds did justice to this ancestry. His sarcophagus is made of beaten lead and encased in gold (see "Treasure" below). Its lid can be pried open with a crowbar or similar tool, revealing nothing but dust within. The stuffed owlbear is a late addition to the crypt's decor-a gift given to [[Strahd]] that wound up here. It looks almost alive but is harmless.

An invisible imp is perched atop the owlbear. If some­ one tries to open the sarcophagus, the imp says in Com­ mon, "I wouldn't do that if I were you!" The imp is mag­ ically bound to King Dostron's remains and must watch over them for several more centuries before its contract are fulfilled. It isn't obligated to protect the contents of the crypt (so it will not attack), and it delights in telling lies and engaging in mischief. For instance, it warns the characters that the sarcophagus is trapped, and that opening the lid will free a pit fiend bound within.

Treasure. Characters who take the time to pry the gold from the sarcophagus can amass 500 gp worth of the precious metal, weighing 10 pounds.

CRYPT 35  
SirJarnwald the Trickster: The joke was on him

"A charnel stench fills this empty crypt."

The floor here is an illusion that hides a 20-foot-deep

pit. The sides of the pit are polished smooth; a creature without a climbing speed can't move along them without the aid of magic or a climber's kit. At the bottom of the pit are six starving ghouls. A permanent silence spell suppresses sound in the pit. The silence can be dis­ pelled, as can the illusory floor (DC 14 for both).

Treasure. Sir Jarnwald was "entombed" he_ re, so far as he was pushed into the crypt-and devoured by the ghouls. What remains o( him lies scattered o� the pit floor: a few scraps ofclcfthirrn:..a�ha�dful cifJeeth, and a· . signet ring that b_ears e ��ylize_d}�?(wpr.t� 2·s·:gi>).

CRYPT 37

Gralmore Nimblenobs - Wizard Ordinaire

Lying on a marble slab in the center of this crypt is the corpse of a man with a long white beard. His skin clings tightly to his skull and bones, and he wears dusty red robes. Clutched to his chest is a wooden staff that has a brass knob on one end and a marble knob on the other.

The staff is a nonmagical quarterstaff.

Inspection of the marble slab reveals a shallow, con­ cave recess at one end. If the marble-knobbed end of Gralmore's staff is placed in the recess, the slab levitates 5 feet upward, revealing a compartment underneath (see "Treasure" below). The slab slowly sinks back into place after 1 minute. If the brass-knobbed end of the staff is placed in the recess, the holder of the staff takes 22 (4dl0) lightning damage.

Treasure. The compartment under the slab holds a small, black leather case containing three spell scrolls (cone ofcold, fireball, and lightning bolt).

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in the compartment with the other treasure.

CRYPT 38  
General Kroval "Mad Dog" Grislek (Master ofthe Hunt): A leader ofhounds and men

When the characters open the door to this crypt, read:

"The stench of brimstone and burnt fur spills from this crypt. In this darkness are three pairs of glowing read eyes."

Three hell hounds lunge forth and attack, fighting to the death. In the round after they attack, General Grislek's wraith emerges from the crypt, uttering commands to the hounds in Infernal. Once these evil creatures are slain, the characters can inspect the crypt more closely.

Bits of incinerated bone lie strewn atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Lying amid the bones are frag­ ments of a shattered spear with a silvered head. The walls and domed ceiling of the crypt are covered with scorched murals that depict legions of infantry and cav­ alry clashing on battlefields.

Beucephalus, the Wonder Horse: May the flowers grow ever brighter where he trods

The door to this crypt is larger than all the others, 6 feet wide by 8 feet tall. Removing or resetting the slab requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. When the door is opened, read:

Dry, hot air and smoke billow from the crypt as a black horse with a flaming mane and fiery hooves emerges. Smoke billows from its nostrils as it rears up to attack.

The nightmare, Beucephalus, is [[Strahd]]'s steed. It has 104 hit points. If the characters slay it, [[Strahd]] hunts them down mercilessly. When the steed wants to leave the castle, it flies up the central shaft of the high tower (area K18a), exiting through the gash in the tower roof (area K59).

CRYPT 40  
Tatsaul Eris - Last ofthe Line

A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Mounted on the north, east, and south walls are three unlit torches in iron brackets.

When a creature enters this tomb for the first time, the torches burst into flame and continue to burn until they are spent or extinguished.

Examination of the skull and bones reveals that they are plaster facsimiles.

K85. SERGEI'S TOMB  
A portcullis is closed in the archway into this tomb. Lift­

ing it requires a successful DC 25 Strength check.

White marble steps descend to a tomb that has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead. A stillness-a calm amid the storm-is felt here. In the center of the tomb, a white marble slab supports an intricately inlaid coffin. Chis­ eled into the slab is a name: Sergei von Zarovich. To the north, behind the coffin, are three alcoves. A beautifully carved statue stands in each alcove-a stunning young man flanked by two angels-looking as polished and new as the day each was placed there. An iron lever protrudes from the south wall, west of the tomb's entrance.

Raising the lever lifts the portcullis at the top of the stairs. Pulling it down lowers the portcullis.

The coffin opens ea.sily to the touch of a lawful good creature. Otherwise, 9pe_ning it requires a successful DC 15 Strength cfieck.·._S�' rgei's flesh has been mag­ ically preserved, and at fir�t glance it looks like he i_s sleeping in his·casket.

TREASURE

Sergei's embalmed body is clothed in shining +2 plate armor.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside the coffin next to Sergei's body.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is lying across Sergei's cof­ fin, weeping.

K86. [[STRAHD]]'S TOMB

A heavy portcullis stands closed in the archway lead­ ing to this tomb. Lifting it requires a successful DC 25 Strength check.

Black marble steps descend to a dark tomb that has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead. The essence of evil permeates the very air. The smell of freshly turned earth is here. Settled into the dirt on the floor is a shining black coffin of finely waxed wood. The coffin's fittings are of brilliant brass, and the lid is closed. South of the coffin are three gloomy alcoves. An iron lever protrudes from the north wall, east of the tomb's entrance.

Raising the lever lifts the J?Ortcullis· at the top of the ,stairs..Pullipgitdownlowersthepor.tcU' llis.

Lying-an4er the ea;t\l:n�;r the east wall of the· tomb:are three vampire spawn°br1deitdressed in SQiled gowns and wearing dirt-encrusted jewelry (see "Treasure" below). They rise to attack anyone who ap­ proaches [[Strahd]]'s coffin.

A detect magic spell reveals that the western and east­ ern alcoves radiate strong auras of conjuration magic. The central alcove is nonmagical.

Creatures that enter the western alcove are instantly teleported to the western alcove of crypt 32 in area K84. Stepping into the eastern alcove has no effect, but any creature that teleports from the eastern alcove of crypt 32 appears here.

TREASURE

[[Strahd]] lavished many fine gifts on his three brides.

Ludmilla Vilisevic wears a soiled white wedding gown, a gold tiara (worth 750 gp), and ten gold bracelets (worth 100 gp each).

Anastrasya Karelova wears a stained and tattered red wedding gown, a black and crimson silk head scarf sewn with precious jewels (worth 750 gp), and a platinum necklace with a black opal pendant (worth 1,500 gp).

Valenta Popofsky wears a faded gold wedding gown, a platinum mask shaped vaguely like a skull (750 gp), and ten platinum rings set with gemstones (worth 250 gp each).

TELEPORT DESTINATION

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive at the bottom of the stairs, just inside the tomb.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies in the center alcove.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is in his coffin, ready to attack anyone who opens the lid.

K87. GUARDIANS

The following text assumes that the characters are approaching from area K84. If they approach this area from area K88, references to descending stairs should be changed to ascending stairs.

Wide steps descend to a landing flanked by two alcoves. Within each alcove, taking up the full thirty-foot height of the ceiling, is a bronze statue of a warrior holding a spear. A soft blue curtain of light flows between the two alcoves. Dimly visible on the other side of the curtain are more descending stairs.

The curtain has no effect �-� cr�·att.i'res,that mo· ve east to west (from area K88 to area :K84)'.

A creature of lawful good. alignment that moves west to east through the curtain can do so without difficulty, but creatures of other alignments that do so are tele­ por:ted back to the top of the stairs behind them. A Small creature can squeeze behind and around one of the bronze statues to circumvent the light curtain.

K88. TOMB OF KING BAROV AND UEEN RAVENOVIA

This tomb rests in hushed silence. Tall, stained glass windows dominate the eastern walls, allowing dim light to fall on two coffins resting atop white marble slabs. The one against the north wall is marked King Barov von Zarovich, and the one against the south wall is marked Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen. The vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead is inlaid with a beautiful gold mosaic.

The stained glass windows are so dirty on the outside

as to be nearly opaque. The windows don't open, but they can be smashed easily. Anyone who looks upward through a window can see, 110 feet above, the castle's stone overlook (area K6). Anyone who falls out a window here plummets almost 900 feet to the base of the Pillar­ stone of Ravenloft.

Prying the gold from the ceiling of this tomb would be a long and tedious effort for little reward.

The north coffin holds a beautifully sculpted, life-sized wax effigy of [[Strahd]]'s father, King Barov. The old king's bones lie in a compartment beneath his effigy.

The south coffin holds the skeleton of [[Strahd]]'s mother, Queen Ravenovia. (The magic that was meant to pre­ serve her earthly remains failed years ago.) A tattered white shroud covers her bones.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies atop Queen Ravenovia's coffin.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is in a frenzy of rage and despair.
