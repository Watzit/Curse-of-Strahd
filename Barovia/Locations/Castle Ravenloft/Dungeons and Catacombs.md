K73. DUNGEON HALL

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by way of the staircase to the east (area K21). Adjust as needed if the characters enter this hall from another direction.

The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water's surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the "thwick" of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.

For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trap­ door opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trap­ door when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.

When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the  
pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens).  
The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn't open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.

Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).

K74. NORTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.

A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. One of the cells is dimly lit.

The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. Light spills out of cell K74h.

A hinged door made up of 1-inch-thick rusted iron bars spaced 4 inches apart, with horizontal crossbars spaced 6 inches apart, closes off each cell. Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.

A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.

Strahd visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here. He can enter a cell by entering mist form.

K74A . FORGOTTEN''TREASUR,E.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73: Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.  
Treasure. Scattered across the floor of this cell are 3,000 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.

K74B. FORGOTTEN 'TREASURE

The rusted door to this cell hangs open slightly.

Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.

Treasure. Scattered across the floor of this cell are 300 pp. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.

K74c. ROTTING CORPSE 

Clinging to the bars of this otherwise empty cell is the rotting corpse of a male half-elf dressed in leather armor.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.

Treasure. A search of the corpse yields a sheathed longsword and two belt pouches, one containing five gemstones (50 gp each) and the other containing a po­ tion ofheroism.

K74D. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K74E. END OFTHE RIDE·  
This cell is linked to a telt,port trap in are.a K73.

Secret Door. A secret door is:s fe.et up from the floor on the north wall of this cell. Tlie secret door can't be opened from this side without.the use of a knock spell or similar magic. Behind the secret door 1s a chute of pol­ ished black marble that slants upward (area K82).

K74F. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K74G. GRAY OOZE

Clinging to the floor of this cell is a gray ooze that at­ tacks anything that enters. While underwater, the ooze is effectively invisible. 

K74H. LOST SWORD

A glowing blade can be seen beneath the water near the back of the cell.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.

Treasure. The source of the underwater glow is a sen­ tient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wis­ dom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmit­ ting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.

, Alawfulgoodcreaturecanattuneitselftothesword in 1 minute.  
While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the crusader's mantle spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.

K75. SOUTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.

A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water  
is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. From one of the cells, you hear a gruff voice ask, "Who's there?"

The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. The voice comes from one of the southernmost cells (area K75a).

K75A. PRISONER

A strong young man clutches the bars of his cell while struggling to keep his teeth from chattering. His clothes are shredded, and he is soaked from head to toe.

The man is Emil Toranescu, a werewolf with 72 hit points. He claims to be a resident of Vallaki who was chased by dire wolves to the castle. He begs the charac­ ters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.

In truth, Strahd locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his werewolf pack (see chapter 15). Anxious to prove his worth to Strahd, Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn't turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika (see chapter 15, area Z7). In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the charac­ ters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.

K75B. FORGOTTEN TREASURE

Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting be­ neath their feet.

Treasure. Scattered across the floor of this cell are 2,100 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.

K75c. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75D. DEAD DWARF

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73. The skeletal remains of a dwarf fighter lie at the bottom of the cell, enclosed in ru�ted plate armor. The dwarf's nonmagical but usable battleax� lies i:iearby.

K75e. EMPTY CELL
This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75F. DEAD WIZARD

Shackled to the back wall of this cell is an emaciated fig­ ure in a blue robe, its spindly arms spread wide and its head tilted forward. Long, gray hair hangs down in front of the dead man's face.

The skeletal figure is all that remains of a human wiz­ ard whom Strahd captured and slowly bled to death. Flesh still clings to the wizard's bones, and puncture marks from the vampire's fangs are visible on the wiz­ ard's neck.

K75G. HANGING BARD

Pounded into the roof of this cell is a rusted iron pulley, strung through which is a rope that is tied to one of the crossbeams of the barred door. Dangling upside down from the pulley is a man, flabby and stout of build, in tight-fitting leather armor. His boots are bound with rope just below the pulley, his fleshy hands are tied behind his back, and his head is underwater. He isn't moving.

Strahd had this human bard suspended from the ceiling as a test to see how long he could keep his head above water. The man weakened and drowned. On the floor of the cell, below the hanging corpse, is a smashed lyre.

K75H. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K76. TORTURE CHAMBER

Dark, low shapes thrust up out of the still, brackish water that fills this fifty-foot-square room, the ceiling of which is festooned with hanging chains that look like thick, black web strands. A balcony set into the north wall over­ looks the room and has two large thrones atop it, with a red velvet curtain behind them.

The ceiling is 17 feet above the surface of the \\'.ater, which is 3 feet deep. The balcony to the north stands 7 feet above the water's surface, IO.feet.above· the floor.
If the characters approach the "dark, low shapes" in the water read:

The dark shapes in the water are racks, iron maidens, stocks, and other instruments of torture. The skeletons of their last victims lie within them, their jaws seemingly frozen open in silent screams.

As soon as one or more characters move more than 10 feet into the room, six Strahd zombies rise slowly out of the water, their slime-gray arms clawing upward through the water as they attack.

K77. OBSERVATION BALCONY ·

Two large, wooden thrones rest on this balcony. Behind the thrones hangs a red velvet curtain thirty feet long. The ceiling here is ten feet high.

The room continues behind the curtain an additional 10 feet to a wall that has a door in its center.

K78. BRAZIER ROOM

This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat. The rim of the brazier is carved with seven cup-shaped inden­ tations spaced evenly around the circumference. Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.

Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.

Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep al­ coves facing each other. The brazier sits between them.

The two statues are iron golems. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circum­ stances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the "Development" section that follows).

The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the·hourglass is-reduced to O hif points, its glass shatt!!fS, ·causing the sand within it to fall to the floor. The magic writing on the base of the hourglass reads as follows:

Cast a stone into the fire:
Violet leads to the mountain spire
Orange to the castle's peak
Red if lore is what you seek
Green to where the coffins hide
Indigo to the master's bride
Blue to ancient magic's womb
Yellow to the master's tomb.

The brazier;s flame is magical and sheds no war'mth. A .. successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) extinguishes. . the fl_ame· for 1 bour. The fire is permanently extin-

. ··-guisnecHf the brazier is destroyed. The brazier.has AC 17, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage.
The stones set into the brazier's rim are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, respec­ tively. Tossing one into the brazier causes its flame to change from white to the color of the stone, and the sand begins falling through the hourglass. Any creature that touches the colored flame is teleported to a location within Strahd's domain, as determined by the color:

Flame Color

Red

Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet

Teleports to ...

Study (area K37)

North tower peak (area K60)  
Strahd's tomb (area K86)  
Coffin maker's shop (chapter 5, area N6f) Amber Temple (chapter 13, area X42)  
Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, area S17) Tsolenka Pass (chapter 9, area T4)

After 5 rounds, the sand runs out, and the color of the flame returns to white. When the flame does so, the sand instantly reappears in the top part of the hourglass (provided the hourglass is intact), and the stone that was cast into the fire reappears in the brazier's rim.

DEVELOPMENT

If the brazier, the hourglass, or either golem is attacked, the doors of the room magically slam shut and lock (unless they are being held or wedged open), and the golems animate and attack. On the first round, the golems fill the room with their poison breath, which issues from the horses' mouths. (Each creature in the room must make two saving throws, one for each breath weapon.) On subsequent rounds, each golem makes one attack with its sword and one slam attack with its hoof. When there are no creatures left to fight in the room, the golems return to their alcoves, and the doors unlock. Forcing open a locked door requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door has AC 15, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

K79. WESTERN STAIR

This staircase of ancient stone is worn smooth. Thick dust covers its steps, and cobwebs choke the passage.

The stairs rise at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 40 feet horizontally, leading to a· 10�foot�square landing (see below).A·secondset-of.stairscontjnuis.upwar.d}o_t�_ e east at a similar angle for p0 di13fan<::�- of 30'fee�liorizon­ tally, ending at a-se.cret.door thai:"c:Stiens-irito:a"rea Kn

LANDING
Inscribed on the landing, hidden 'under years of dust, is a glyph of warding. If the characters brush away the dust, someone can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

The glyph triggers the first time a living creature passes over it. Triggering it activates a major image spell, conjuring an illusion of Strahd von Zarovich that appears either halfway up the stairs leading to area K72 or halfway down the stairs leading to area K78, so that the vampire appears in front of the triggering character. When "Strahd" appears, read:

A sickly mist fills the stairway ahead, then coalesces into the form of the vampire Strahd, his eyes burning red with anger. "You have worn out your welcome," he says. "Whatever gods you believe in cannot save you now!"

Have the characters roll initiative. Any attack or spell that hits "Strahd" passes through, revealing that he is an illusion. On initiative count 0, the illusory vampire chuckles and melts away like a wax doll in a bonfire, leaving no trace behind, and the glyph disappears.

K80. CENTER STAIR  
If the characters enter this area through the door at the bottom of the stairs read:

The door creaks open to reveal a stone staircase between rough masonry walls. There is little dust on the steps, but light fog tumbles down the steps from above.

If the characters enter this area at the top of the stair­ case, read:

The rough-hewn corridor ends at a stone staircase that descends to the south. Flanked by walls of rough ma­ sonry and relatively free of dust, these stairs descend before ending at a lonely door.

The stairs slope at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 20 feet horizontally, connecting areas K78 and K81.

K81. TuNNEL

This tunnel is cut into the Pillarstone of Ravenloft itself. Its surface is slick, and its ceiling is barely 6 feet high. A lingering fog limits visibility to a few feet.

Characte�s who have knoJi�dge. of stdnecutting'dm tell· .- ._· that this passage is a relatively°pew consfr.uction tom-. pared to other areas of Ravenlofi;. The t�nn�Us-120 feet long, with a stone door at its·easte�n end.
Nearthemidpointofthe'turu'i�lis·iitrapdoorhidden under a layer 9f fog. Characters can't spot the trap­ door passively, but art ��tive search accompanied by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check locates it. Unless the tr�pdoor is fastened shut with an iron spike or by some other means, it opens when 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on it. When the trapdoor opens, everyone who is standing on it slides into the marble chute below (area K82). The trapdoor then resets.

K82. MARBLE SLIDE

If one or more characters fall through the trapdoor in area K81, read:
"You fall into a chute of polished black marble slide into the darkness"

The chute plunges from the trapdoor in area K81 through a one-way secret door into a flooded cell (area K74e). Characters who slide all the way to the bottom are deposited in the cell, but take no damage. The slide contains no handholds and is too slippery to ascend without the aid of magic.

K83. SPIRAL STAIR

Behind the door lies a dark spiral staircase.

The staircase starts at area K78, climbs to a landing at area K83a, and continues upward to area K37.

K83A. SPIRAL STAIR LANDING

An extension of area K83, this landing is shown on map 11.

This forty-foot-long corridor connects two spiral stair­ ways, one leading up and the other descending into the depths of Castle Ravenloft. Hanging from an iron rod bolted to the eastern wall is a dusty, ten-foot-square tap­ estry depicting knights on horseback charging across a battlefield under a bloodred sky. The lead knight rides a black horse and wears a fur-lined black cloak, dark gray armor, and a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. His sword glows with the light of the sun.

The stairs at the nor.th end of the west wall descends to a door leading to area K78. The stairs at the south end of the west wall lead up, ending at door that opens into area K37.

TREASURE

The tapestry depicts Strahd's father, King Barov, lead­ ing his fearsome knights into.glorious battle. The tap­ estry weighs 10 pounds arid ·is· worth 750 gp intact. If it becomesdamageifwhileiiith_ eparty'spossession,itis worthless unless mende,d.

K84. CATACOMBS

Buried deep beneath the �eep of Ravenloft lie ancient catacombs, with arched ceilings supported by wide, hol­ low columns that double as crypts. Cobwebs hang limp in the musty air. A thick fog clings to the Acor, which is covered in putrid waste. The black ceiling is moving.

The catacombs fill an area roughly 110 feet east to west by 180 feet north to south, and the floor is covered in several inches of bat guano. The catacombs are made up of 10-foot-wide arched walkways running between 10-foot-square crypts, which serve as pillars that sup­ port the 20-foot-high ceiling. The area has five means of entry and exit:

Thedooradjacenttocrypt1(connecting with area K81)

, Abarredarchwaytothenorth(connecting with area K85)

A barred archway to the south (connecting with area K86 but warded by teleport traps)

• Thehightowerstair(areaK18)ortheshaft(area K18a) to the west

, Abarredarchwaytotheeast(connecting with area K87)

Each crypt is sealed with a chiseled stone "door"-ac­ tually a tight-fitting stone slab measuring 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 3 inches thick. Removing or resetting a stone slab requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Each crypt houses the remains of the person or per­ sons whose epitaph is inscribed on the front of the slab. The crypts are described in the following sections, their epitaphs noted under the crypt's number in italics.

Unless noted otherwise, each crypt contains a 3-foot­ by-6-foot rectangular bier of marble, 3 feet high, with a skeleton draped in rags lying atop it.

The catacombs are home to tens of thousands of bats.

The bats hang here during daytime hours and fly out in the evening through the high tower's central shaft (area K18a) to hunt at night. They will not attack intruders unless they are provoked or are specifically commanded to do so by Strahd. If one or more bats within a 10-foot square on the map are attacked or caught in the area of a harmful spell, 2d4 swarms of bats form in that area and attack. No more swarms can be formed in that square until the next dawn, when more bats arrive to replenish those that were killed.

TELEPORT TRAPS

Invisible teleport traps are lo.cated between crypts 37 and 38, .between crypt 3� and the wall south of it, and · between crypt 38 and the wa!Lsciuth of it. The. traps can'tbeperceiveqexcepf�it1{�f}a¢;cfpiagic'spell, whtih.i:ey_�13ii,ran',a1,1ra of cd�}ur�tlonr· iiagic in the trapped areas. Although the traps can't be disarmed, a successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) on a trap sup­ presses its magic for 1 minute, allowing characters to move safely through its area. A trap is also suppressed while wholly or partly in the area of an antimagic field.

These teleport traps form a protective ring around the entrance to Strahd's tomb (area K86). Any creature that enters one of these 10-foot-square spaces is instantly teleported away, switching places with one of the wights in crypt 14. The wight materializes in the creature's pre­ vious location and attacks any living creature it sees.

CRYPT 1

Herein lie the ones who walk the path ofpain and tor­ ment

The stone door connects not with a crypt, but with a hewn tunnel of stone (area K81).

CRYPT2

Artista DeSlop - Court Ceiling Painter  
The domed ceiling of this crypt is painted with an image

of imps holding bouquets of colorful flowers. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. A wooden box is tucked under one bony hand.

The box is unlocked. It contains seven wood-handled paintbrushes and seven small gourds of dried-up paint.

CRYPT 3  
Lady Isolde Yunk (Isolde the Incredible): Purveyor of antiques and imports

A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Piled all around it, covering the floor, are heaps of old baskets, braziers, bundled tapestries, candlesticks, chairs, chests, cooking utensils, cressets, curtain rods, decanters, dishes, jugs, lamps, scroll cases, tankards, and tinderboxes. None of the junk looks valu­ able. An old chandelier hangs from the domed ceiling.

Characters could spend hours searching the crypt. Though the antiques here might fetch a fair amount of coin, they are hardly worth the trouble to transport.

CRYPT 4

The apparition of a large, rotund man forms within the dark crypt, its eyes wild with insanity. Large, artificial wings unfold from its back.

Prince Ariel was a terrible man who longed to fly. He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn't bear his weight, and he plunged from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to his death. His evil ghost attacks the char­ acters on sight. If Ariel succeeds in possessing a char­ acter, his host climbs the high tower (area K18) until it reaches the peak (area K59), then hurls itself down the tower's central shaft (area K18a), screaming, "I can fly!" the whole way down.

CRYPT 5

Artank Swilovich: Friend and member ofthe Barovian Wine Distillers Guild

You are greeted by the faint smell of wine. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Heaped around it, covering the entire floor, are thousands of empty wine bottles.

Each bottle's label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery, and the label names the wine inside: Champagne du le Stomp, Red Dragon Crush, or Purple Grapemash No. 3.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried under the wine bottles. A character who searches under the bottles finds the treasure automatically.

CRYPT 6

Saint Markovia: Dead for all time

The 10-foot-square section of floor in front of this crypt is a pressure plate that releases four poison darts hid­ den in tiny holes in the north wall. (See "Sample Traps" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide for the rules on how this trap functions.) The trap resets when the weight is lifted and can be triggered a total of four times before its supply of darts is depleted.

If the door to the crypt is opened, read:

"This crypt smells of roses. The remains atop its marble

slab have disintegrated, except for one thighbone."

If the charc,1cters disturb Safot Mar. kovia's remains, add: "A ghostly form appears above the dust, so faint that you can barely discern more than part of a face. From this apparition comes the faintest of whispers: "The vampire must be destroyed. Use me as your weapon." With that, it fades away."

Treasure. A detect magic spell reveals that the thigh­ bone radiates an aura of evocation magic. See appendix C for more information on Saint Markovia's thighbone.

CRYPT 7

"The stone door of this crypt lies on the floor, its inscription obscured by fog. The crypt gapes open. A skull, some bones, and a few bits of rusted armor lie atop a marble slab with a leering stone gargoyle squatting at each end."

The epitaph on the door reads "Endorovich (Endorovich the Terrible): What the blood of a hundred wars did not do, the spurn of a woman accomplished."
Endorovich was a ruthless soldier and self-aggrandizing 


yles. If anyone disturbs the bones on the slab, one  
of the gargoyles awakens and attacks. If the gargoyle is reduced to O hit points, Endorovich's spirit moves to the second gargoyle, which then awakens and attacks. Both gargoyles have maximum hit points (77 ). Once the second gargoyle is destroyed, Endorovich's spirit is laid to rest.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is contained in a secret compartment under Endorovich's remains. Once his bones and dust are swept away, the compartment can be found and opened without an ability check.
