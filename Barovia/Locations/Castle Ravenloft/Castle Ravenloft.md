Castle [[Ravenloft]] is [[Strahd]]'s accursed sanctuary. Here [[Strahd]] committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all [[Barovia]] remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and [[Strahd]]'s other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle's vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count's home. [[Strahd]] keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing. Castle [[Ravenloft]] is detailed in the adventure Curse of Strahd.



Castle Ravenloft was built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to Strahd's family. Strahd rewarded the castle's genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle's catacombs. The castle was named after Strahd's mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below.

The poster map that accompanies this book displays the castle in its entirety. Map 1 on the poster shows a diagram of the castle's face, and the other maps show the castle's interior and exterior areas. All those locations are described in this chapter, starting in the "Walls of Ravenloft" section on page 52.
