Castle [[Ravenloft]] is [[Strahd]]'s accursed sanctuary. Here [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all [[Barovia]] remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle's vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count's home. [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]] keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing. Castle [[Ravenloft]] is detailed in the adventure Curse ofStrahd.
