Castle [[Ravenloft]] is [[Strahd]]'s accursed sanctuary. Built atop the ruin of an older fortress by artisans, wizards, and workers loyal to [[Strahd]]'s family. [[Strahd]] rewarded the castle's genius architect, Artimus, with a crypt in the castle's catacombs. The castle was named after [[Strahd]]'s mother, Ravenovia, who also lies entombed below. Here [[Strahd]] committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all [[Barovia]] remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and [[Strahd]]'s other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle's vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count's home. [[Strahd]] keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing.

The poster map that accompanies this book displays the castle in its entirety. Map 1 on the poster shows a diagram of the castle's face, and the other maps show the castle's interior and exterior areas.

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The first time the characters enter a castle area that isn't otherwise occupied, check for a random encounter. Also check for a random encounter every 10 minutes the characters spend resting in the castle.

In most circumstances, a random encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20. To determine what the characters encounter, consult the table below.

Use the descriptions that follow to run each encounter.

BAROVIAN COMMONERS
___________________
"A loud clamour fills the unhallowed halls of Ravenloft. Cries of "Kill the vampire!" are mixed with bold voices shouting, "Never again!" and "To the crypts!""
___________________

Angry villagers who have entered the castle brandish torches and pitchforks in a ridiculous display of force. Everywhere they go, they shout for justice. They follow the characters unless prevented from doing so. As long as these [[Barovians]] are with the adventurers, random encounters occur on a roll of 9 or higher.

BAROVIAN WITCH
___________________
"You hear a woman's scratchy voice calling out a name. "Grizzlegut! Grizzlegut, where are you? A pox on you, you mangy cat!"

Through the darkness comes a crone wearing a pointed black hat and a burlap gown stained with soot."
___________________
Characters can try to hide from the witch (who has darkvision) or catch her by surprise. This Barovian witch is one of the servants of [[Strahd]] dwelling in area K56. She is calling out the name of her black cat familiar, which has gone missing. If the characters confront her, the old bat spits at them and begins casting a spell.

This encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

BLACK CAT 
_____________
The darkness lets out a demonic hiss as a black cat darts out of the shadows, trying its best to avoid you.
_____________

This familiar is searching for its mistress (a Barovian witch). It wants nothing to do with the characters but attacks if cornered.

If the characters capture or kill the cat, this encounter doesn't occur again. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

BLINSKY TOY

A Blinsky toy is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, treat this result as no encounter.

_____________
"You find a discarded toy-something no child could love."
_____________

The toy has a slogan stitched or printed on it in tiny letters: "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" Roll a d6 to determine the specific toy:

| d6  | Toy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | A plush werewolf stuffed with sawdust and tiny wood carved babies. It has dull knife blades for claws and retractable teeth.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | A smiling jester marionette with tangled strings and tiny copper bells sewn into its cap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3   | A wooden puzzle box, 6 inches on a side, carved with silhouettes of leering clown faces. The box rattles when shaken. A character who spends a short rest fiddling with the box can figure out how to open it with a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. The box is empty, with nothing inside to explain the rattling. |
| 4   | A faceless doll in a wedding dress that has yellowed and frayed with age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5   | A vaguely coffin-shaped jack-in-the-box containing a pop-up Strahd puppet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6   | A spring-loaded set of wooden teeth with fangs, all painted white. The teeth gnash and chatter for 1 minute when the spring is wound tight (requiring an action) and released.                                                                                                                                           | 


BROOM OF ANIMATED ATTACK

___________
You hear a scratching noise. Out of the shadows comes a broom, sweeping its way toward you as though held by invisible hands.
___________

When it gets within 5 feet of a party member, the broom attacks.

CRAWLING CLAWS

___________
A mob of severed hands, their mummified Aesh black with soot, skitters out of the darkness across the dusty floor.
___________

The crawling claws gang up on one party member. During the confusion, one of the claws tries to crawl into the character's backpack and hide there. It makes  
a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If the claw loses the contest, the character sees the claw enter the backpack. If the claw wins the contest, it waits until the character takes a long rest before scuttling out to attack.

CRAWLING STRAHD ZOMBIE

The groans are coming from a Strahd zombie that is missing both of its legs, so that only its head, torso, and arms remain. It uses its arms to drag itself across the floor. The crawling zombie has 15 hit points remaining.

If the characters are moving quietly and not using light sources, they can try to hide from the crawling zombie.

EZMERELDA D'AVENIR

Ezmerelda has cast a greater invisibility spell on herself and is stealthily exploring the castle. Choose one character in the back rank of the party's marching order, and read the following text to that character's player:

_____________
"You feel a gentle tap on your shoulder but see nothing behind you."
_____________

If the character who is touched by Ezmerelda reacts in an alarming or threatening manner, she hastily whispers, "Don't be frightened. We're on the same side."

Ezmerelda is hunting Strahd, but her efforts to corner the vampire have so far been thwarted, and she fears that she might be in over her head. If the characters don't ask her to join the party, she wishes them well and goes on her way (perhaps to be encountered again later). If they invite her to accompany them, Ezmerelda tests the characters' knowledge about vampires by asking them questions such as. "Have you ever seen a vampire change its form?" and "Do you know how to counteract a vampire's regenerative ability?'' Whatever their answers, she ultimately agrees to come along.

This random encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

FLYING SWORDS

_______
"Out of the gloom flies a rusty blade, followed by another!"
_______
If more than two flying swords are encountered, the others aren't far behind. These weapons drift about the castle and attack intruders within range of their blindsight.

GIANT SPIDER COCOON

IA giant spider cocoon is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, reroll.

_______
'A white cocoon is suspended from the ceiling amid thick webs and appears to hold something human-like.'
_______

A giant spider made this cocoon. Characters who can reach it can cut it open to free whatever is inside. Roll a d6 to determine the cocoon's contents:

| d6  | Cocoon's Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | A wooden mannequin wearing a gown.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2   | A Barovian witch (see appendix D). She screams like a wild animal and begins casting spells.                                                                                                                        |
| 3   | A Strahd zombie (see appendix D). It fights until killed.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4   | A Barovian lunatic (CN male commoner). If freed, he cackles until silenced or until a calm emotions spell is cast on him. A lesser restoration spell cures his madness, at which point he tries to flee the castle. |
| 5   | A dead Barovian that serves as host to a swarm of insects (spiders). The baby giant spiders (each one the size of a tarantula) crawl out of the Barovian's gaping mouth or burst forth from its distended belly.    |
| 6   | A Vistana bandit (CN male or female). The Vistana knows the castle's layout and helps the characters until Strahd or more Vistani appear, at which point the treacherous Vistana turns on the characters.           |

RAHADIN

If Rahadin was killed or captured in a previous encounter, this encounter doesn't occur. Otherwise, Strahd's mysterious chamberlain approaches quietly. A character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds Rahadin's Dexterity (Stealth) check hear him.

________
"The master wishes to see you," intones a grim voice in the darkness.
________

Rahadin directs the characters to a random location in the castle, determined by rolling a d6:

| d6  | Location                 |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | Chapel (area Kl 5)       |
| 2   | Audience hall (area K25) |
| 3   | Study (area K37)         |
| 4   | Tower roof (area K57)    |
| 5   | Wine cellar (area _K63)  |

Strahd isn't actually at that location unless the card reading (see chapter 1) indicates that he is.

If the characters ask Rahadin to lead the way, he de­ clines. If the characters ask for directions, he tells them whether they need to ascend, descend, or remain on the level they're at. If they attack him, he fights to the death. Otherwise, he doesn't leave until after they do.

Strahd makes a surprise appearance.

A crack of thunder shakes the castle, stirring the dust and cobwebs. You hear a voice: "Good evening."

tiny black wings. Suddenly, a dark cloud of bats descends Iter, this encounter doesn't occur. Otherwise, Strahd's I upon you!

UNSEEN SERVANT

A curious object drifts into view, as though held aloft by an invisible force.
