K47. P ORTRAIT OF STRAHD

You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty

feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.

An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet pene­ trating gaze.

The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It at­ tacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it.
Underneath the rug is a bare stone .floor.

The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on.a.side and as thick as··the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring buiit into the si. de opposit ethe hinges.

The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can't be removed without de­ stroying it.

If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the guardian por­ trait (see appendix D) attacks.

K48. 0FFSTAIR  
This spiraling staircase is dark and dusty.

II This stairway rises from area K47, past area K54,

to area K57.

K49. LOUNGE

As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.

The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in  
the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd's mood improves.  
If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of mel­ ancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the cata­ combs (area K84) with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

The books in the bookcase have no value and aren't much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include Embalming: The Lost Art, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, Castle Building 101, and Goats of the Balinok Mountains.

TREASURE

On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a plat­ inum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pen­ dant (worth 750 gp).

K50. GUEST ROOM

A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four cor­ ner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.

There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of ld4 Baro­ vian witches from area K56. They try to subdue the party with sleep spells. A witch retreats to area K56

if wounded.

K51. CLOSET

This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.

The cloak is ordinary. The witches in area K56 placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secn,t trapdoor in. the ceiling.

The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Lo­ cating the trapdoor doesn't enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs. Once it has been found, the trap­ door can be opened by pulling on the hook, or it can be unlocked by someone using thieves' tools, a knock spell, or similar magic. It swings down when unlocked

K52. SMOKESTACK

Jutting from the steeply sloping rooftop of the castle, a spindly smokestack, five feet in diameter at the top, rises thirty feet above the roof's peak. Smoke belches from its iron-pronged capstone.

The chimney leads down 60 feet to the blazing fireplace in area K37. A creature that starts its turn in the chim­ ney takes 3 (ld6) fire damage.

K53. ROOFTOP

Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping rooftop. Flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof's end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the courtyard some one hundred thirty feet below.

If a character tries to traverse the rooftop, read:

Some of the ancient roof tiles slide easily underfoot, eas­ ily dropping into the fog-shrouded darkness. Each falling tile resounds with a hollow click as it hits the flagstones of the parapet or courtyard below.

A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acro­ batics) check to traverse the roof. The check succeeds automatically if the character crawls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides off the edge of the roof ans falls 40 feet to the castle parapet (area K46).

K54. FAMILIAR ROOM

The low ceiling of this twenty-foot-square room presses down on you. Torn and broken couches lie in heaps, hap­ hazardly strewn about. Deep claw marks cover the hard­ wood furniture, and the once lush upholstery has been sliced to shreds. From the dark shadows amid the rubble, three pairs of green eyes stare back at you.

The three c.ats are familiars ·of-the•lit��es in ai,ea .�so..  
If the fa miliars see the characters here, the witches are ....

alerted\�t��irpreserit'y

K55. ELEMENT ROOM

Heavy beams support the ceiling of this large room, the outer wall of which curves to follow the shape of the tower. Dim light filters into the room through the steel lattice squares of two leaded glass windows. Several ta­ bles stand throughout the room, weighed down by stacks of glass jars and bottles, all of them bearing labels.

The labeled glass containers hold various elements that the witches use in their fell concoctions and rituals. The labels identify such items as "Eye of Newt," "Hair of Bat," "Snail Hearts," and "Frog's Breath." There are no magic potions among the bottles and jars.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They are currently locked from the in­ side. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

Characters who search the room spot numerous boot prints in the dust, as well as a short trail in the dust on the floor, leading from the northeast corner of the room to the easternmost door. It looks like something heavy was dragged across the floor toward the doorway.

There is a secret trapdoor in the northeast corner

of the floor. Because of the trail through the dust, the trapdoor can be found without an ability check. Tapping or knocking on the trapdoor three times releases a hidden latch, causing the trapdoor to swing down. Area KSl lies below. (There's no ability check that will let the characters figure out the trick to opening the door. They can get that information from the witches, or perhaps by using a divination spell or similar magic.)

K56. CAULDRON

Characters who stand outside the door to this room can smell a pungent odor coming from within.

If the witches in this room have not been warned that the characters are coming, the characters can hear their horrid cackling. If the characters open the door slightly, they witness the scene described below:

Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are several gaunt women in soiled black robes. These witches sit hunched on tall wooden stools, their tangled hair tucked under black, pointed hats. They take turns tossing ingredients into the cauldron, uttering fell incantations, and cackling maniacally.

: If the 'witches know the characters are coming, read the ·following text instead:

Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppres­ sive room. Surrounding the cauldron are seven tall wooden stools.

The Barovian witches (see appendix D) that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd's service  
in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are pres­ ent when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in area KSO. If  
the witches are expecting the characters, they cast in­ visibility spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using alter self

When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word ("Gorah!"), it magi­ cally heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron's property has been used, the cauldron can't be activated again until the next dawn.

Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor  
in area KSS.

TREASURE

Each witch carries a potion of healing that she made herself. There is a 30 percent chance that a potion has "gone bad," in which case it's actually a potion ofpoison.

Not visible from the entrance is a small table behind the cauldron on which sits an opened spellbook, seem­ ingly on the verge of falling apart. The book is evil. Any non-evil creature that touches it or starts its turn with the book in its possession takes 5 (ldlO) psychic dam­ age. The book contains the following spells:

1st level: burning hands, charm person, detect magic, find familiar, fog cloud, mage armor, protection from evil and good, ray ofsickness, sleep, Tasha's hideous laugh­ ter, unseen servant, witch bolt

2nd level: alter self, arcane lock, cloud ofdaggers, darkness, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock, misty step

K57. TOWER ROOF

The sixty-foot-diameter tower roof is rimmed with battle­ ments. A slender stone bridge with no railing spans the gap between this tower and the slightly taller tower to the north. To the east, the high tower of Ravenloft thrusts skyward with no apparent opening at this level. Black, boiling clouds hurl rain down from above.

The courtyard is 190 feet below, the roof of the keep 80 fe�t below. A stone railing encloses a stone spiral stair­ case _that descends into the tower.

K58. BRIDGE

A strong wind blows across this slender bridge of stone and masonry. The bridge's old iron railings have rusted away years ago, leaving the bridge without handholds.

The bridge connects areas K20 and K57. The wind isn't strong enough to knock creatures off the bridge, but a creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet onto the roof of the keep.

K59. HIGH TOWER PEAK

If the characters climb the stairs to reach the tower peak, read:

The spiral staircase finally ends at a five-foot-wide stone walkway that circles the shaft. In the center of the tower's highest floor, a fifteen-foot-diameter ·hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself. Cold air rushes up out of the shaft, sending a chill through you. Arrow slits line the walls, and aging beams support a steep, cone-shaped roof. One beam and part of the roof have fallen away, leaving a gaping hole open to the stormy sky.

The hole in the floor forms the mouth of an enclosed shaft (area K18a) that descends 450 feet to the castle catacombs (area K84).

PIDLWICK II

Hiding in the rafters is Pidlwick II (see appendix D). A character spots Pidlwick II with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score that meets or exceeds its Dexterity (Stealth) check. If Pidlwick II is spotted, read:

Something lurks among the rafters-a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack­ o'-lantern.

Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool's costume, Pidlwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidlwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.

If the characters see Pidlwick II in bright light, read:

It's obvious that you're looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears

Pidlwick II can't speak and doesn't have an expressive face, so he relies mostly on hand gestures and simple di­ agrams to communicate. He understands Common but can't read or write.

If the characters show kindness to the clockwork ef­ figy, it accompanies them and tries its best to be helpful and entertaining. It knows its way around the castle and can serve as a silent guide.

If one or more characters are mean toward Pidlwick II, its quiet resentment of them grows, and at some point when the group is at the top of a staircase, it pushes one of the offending party members down the stairs. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble to the bottom of the staircase, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.

K60. NORTH TOWER PEAK

If the characters climb the stairs to this area, read:

The stairs end at a dark and dreary room with manacles attached to the walls. In the middle of the room is a wood-framed bed fitted with leather restraints. At the foot of the bed rests a closed iron chest, is lid sculpted with an emblem.

A wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.

Thin streams of water drip through the trapdoor's rotting wood, forming a puddle around the base of the ladder.

The ceiling here is 9 feet high. The manacles are rusted and can be easily torn from the walls. The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the tower rooftop (area K60a).

The emblem worked into the lid of the iron chest is Strahd's family crest. (Show the players Strahd's crest on page 239.) Cyrus Belview (see area K62) stashed the chest here for safekeeping.

TREASURE

The iron chest is locked, and its key is with Cyrus Bel­ view in area K62.

The chest contains a bejeweled gold crown (worth 2,500 gp) resting on a silk pillow.

TELEPORT DESTINATION

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in the middle of the room.

FORTUNES OF .RAVENLO,FT  
If your card reading reveals.that a treasure'. is here, it is inside the iron chest.
If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is standing next to the iron chest.

K60A. NORTH TOWER ROOFTOP

A cold wind greets you atop the tower roof, its rain­ slicked flagstones surrounded by a twenty-foot-diameter ring of stone battlements. The thunderclouds above sud­ denly coalesce into the terrible visage of Strahd. The face utters a ghastly moan as thousands of bats fly out of its gaping maw and descend upon the tower.

Characters who remain on the roof are accosted by ten swarms of bats, which arrive in 3 rounds. If the char­ acters descend into the tower, the bats don't follow and instead fly into the high tower (area K59), descend its central shaft (area K 18a), and roost in the catacombs (area K84).

The courtyard lies 260 feet below, and the roof of the keep is 130 feet below.

K61. ELEVATOR TRAP

See area K31 and the accompanying Elevator Trap dia­ gram before running this encounter.

This dusty, ten-foot-wide, thirty-foot-long corridor has a flat ceiling ten feet overhead. To the south, a web-filled stairway spirals down into darkness. The north end of the hall ends at a wooden door.

This hallway contains an elevator trap, triggered when at least 400 pounds of pressure is applied to the 10-foot­ square section of floor in the center of the hall (marked T on the map), or when the lever in area K31 is raised. A party of adventurers moving in close formation down the hall is certainly heavy enough to trigger the trap.

A character who searches for traps while crossing the hall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects seams in the floor, walls, and ceiling that suggest that the middle section isn't attached to. the rest of the hall. A character.who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ( Investigation) check discerris that the trap· can't be disarmed from this location..

The middle 10-foot section of .tbe hall is;a cl�verly hid­ den elevator compartment, open tolben. orth �nd ·south so that it appears to b.e pirtqfthe p�ssageway. When the trap is sprung, two·st��l portcullis�s drop frdm the ceiling at lightning speed -to seal-9ff the compartment, trapping within those creatur¢sl�atctdgger�d the trap. An instant later, the closed-off ele�ator fa .propelled up the western half of a 20-focit�wide:'i70�foot-tall shaft (area K3la) to the sounds.of turni�·g ge�rs and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas 'fflls the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious as though affected by a sleep spell.

At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, fill­ ing the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.

Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can't be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.

All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including unconscious ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath area K47. Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occu­ pants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other ac­ tions. Unconscious ones can do nothing.

A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a success­ ful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens downward.

Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.

The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in area K31 is moved to the "down" position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft. When the eleva­ tor reaches the bottom, its portcullises rise again.

This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark fig­ ure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.

The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a mongrel­ folk (see appendix D) and Strahd's faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches ta11 but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck's webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.

The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in area K60. The wooden pendant is

a hag eye given to Cyrus by the night hag Morgantha (see chapter 6), so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn't know that the necklace is magical. See the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Man­ ual for information about the hag eye.

Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their "room in the tower" (area K49). If the characters aren't sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.

If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to area K61 and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (area K31), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he's still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to area K47 and either leads the characters to area K49 or if they're unconscious, drags them there. After assurin� characters who are conscious that "the master will be along shortly," Cyrus then makes his way back down­ stairs to the kitchen (area K65).

If the characters don't go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in area K65. If the characters take his key, he screams, "The master will not be pleased!" and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check is enough to make him divulge the key's purpose, the location of the iron chest' and the chest's contents.

When he isn't being threatened, Cyrus giggles to him­ self from time to time for no" clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at (he most.inopportune moments.

Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to area K 23.

Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcul­ lis that bars the way to area K63. (If the characters pe�r through the portcullis, read the boxed text for area K63.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC

20 Strength check.

The double doors ai:· the west end of the hall are made of heavy ,planks barided .with steel. They open into area K67.

K63. WINE CELLAR

Arched frames of stone form a low, wet ceiling over this wine cellar. Great casks line the walls, their bands rusting and their contents long since spilled onto the floor. A few hungry rats make their home here, but upon your sudden arrival, they retreat to the shadows.

The rats are harmless. Cyrus Belview (see area K62) treats them like pets.

Characters who search the room find a crack at the southern end of the west wall. The crack is half an inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to area K18.

WINE CASKS

Each of the twelve large casks here rests on its side in

a heavy wooden brace. Three casks stand against the north wall, six against the east wall, and three against the south wall. Decorative lettering is burned into the top of each cask, showing the winery name-the Wizard of Wines-and the name of the wine in the cask.

Northern Casks. All three of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine's name is Champagne du le Stomp.

Eastern Casks. Five of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Red Dragon Crush. Lining the interior of the sixth one is a patch of yellow mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Ad­ venture Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A character who inspects the cask closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check sees yellow mold in the cracks between the planks of the cask. If this cask is smashed open, the yellow mold releases a cloud of spores.

Southern Casks. Two of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Purple Grape­ mash No. 3. The middle one is home to a purplish black pudding that bursts forth if the cask is broken open.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside one of the empty casks along the north wall, hid­

lden there by Cyrus Belview.

K64. GUARDS' STAIR l

The long, hollow sigh of the wind breathes a semblance of life into this otherwise featureless staircase.

The stairway starts at area K68 and goes up past area K13 to area K46.

K65. KITCHEN

A horrible odor of decay fills this steaming hot room. A huge pot bubbles over a blazing fire pit in the center of the room, its green, muddy contents churning. The far wall is lined with pegs, hanging from which are numer­ ous large cooking implements-some of which could easily double as implements of torture.

If a character looks into the pot, three human zombies rise up from the bubbling depths and attack. The zom­ bies are slowly being boiled to death, and each has only 13 hit points remaining. If Cyrus Belview (see area K62) is present when the zombies attack, he grabs a heavy club and tries to beat them back into the pot. Cyrus ex­ plains that he just isn't the cook he used to be, and his meals tend to get out of hand these days.

K66. BUTLER'S UARTERS

This twenty-foot-square room is filled wall to wall with clutter. A long, sagging bed sits to one side under a huge faded tapestry that depicts Castle Ravenloft. Dusty lan­ terns sit in various places, and bright curtains are draped haphazardly about the room. Thousands of pieces of junk cover the Aoor. Broken swords, crumpled shields, and helmets lie in piles all about.

Cyrus Belview (see area K62) uses this room as his lair. There is nothing of value here.

If Cyrus is with the party, the characters notice that he is caressing ·their equipment and chuckling to him­ self. Cyrus has been salvaging equipment from dead adventurers for years. He looks forward to adding to his collection after Strahd gets through with the characters.

K67. HALL OF BONES

Once a mess hall for the castle guards, this room is now desecrated ground (see "Wilderness Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Dark stains cover the Aoor of this area. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Replacing them are furnishings made entirely of human bones.

The walls and the twenty-foot-high vaulted ceiling are

a sickly yellow color, not because of faded or timeworn plaster but because they are adorned with bones and skulls arranged in a morbidly decorative fashion, giv-  
ing the room a cathedral-like quality. Four enormous mounds of bones occupy the corners of this ossuary, and garlands of skulls extend from these mounds to a chan­ delier of bones that hangs from the ceiling above a long table constructed of bones in the center of the room.

Ten chairs made of bones and festooned with decorative skulls surround the table, resting atop which is an ornate, bowl-shaped vessel made of yet more bones.

The doors to the north and south are sheathed in bone, but the steel-banded double doors in the center of the east wall are not. Above these eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon.

Cyrus Belview (see area K62) created this enormous work of art out of the bones of dead servants and slain adventurers. It has taken him many years to complete it. The bones and skulls are held together with gray mortar and white paste. The dark stains on the floor are old bloodstains, caused here when Strahd _hunted down and killed the remainder of his castle guards.

The dragon skull mounted above the eastern doors belongedtoArgynvost(seechapter7),a·silver,oragon that was killed in the valley by Strahd and his army be­ fore the founding of Castie Ravenloft. The s·kull weighs 250 pounds. · · ··

K68. GUARDS' RUN

This ten-foot-wide arched corridor is cold and moist. The cold seems to emanate from an open archway in the west wall.

The archway leads to area K69. A door at the north end of the hall opens into area K67. To the south, the hallway ends at the foot of a staircase (area K64) that spirals upward.

K69. GUARDS' QUARTERS

Sickly, yellow lichen covers the ceiling of this cold, damp, ten-foot-wide passage running east and west. Opening off both sides of this passage are ten-foot-square alcoves that contain rotting cots, rags, and the skeletal remains of castle guards. A deathly silence fills the hall.

The yellow lichen is harmless. When one or more char­ acters reach the midpoint of the hall, ten human skele­ tons leap from the alcoves and attack.

K70. KINGSMEN HALL

This thirty-foot-square room is a shambles. Scattered fur­ niture lies in heaps near the walls. Broken bones lie scat­ tered amid crumpled and crushed plate armor. Shields and swords jut from the walls as if driven into them by some tremendous force.

Two doors stand opposite one another in the center of the north wall and the south wall. A dark archway leads out through the east wall.

After Strahd was transformed into a vampire, several of the castle guards retreated to this room, but Strahd caught them and slaughtered them in a brutal show of violence. Removing one of the shields or swords from the wall requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. None of the items found here are valuable.

K71. KINGSMEN QUARTERS

This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are four ten-foot-square alcoves cluttered with rotting cots and dirty rags. The ceilings here are covered with yellow lichen.

TREASURE

Three of the alcoves contain nothing of value. A loose flagstone in the southeast alcove covers a hidden cub­ byhole in the floor, in which is hidden a moldy sack containing 150 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character who searches the alcove can find the loose flagstone with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

This shadowy room is in perfect order. A great table stands here with its chair, inkwell, and quill set carefully in place. Lances, swords, and shields that bear the Baro­ vian crest are hung neatly on the dark, oak-paneled walls.

If he has not been defeated elsewhere, Rahadin (see appendix D) is here, waiting for the characters to arrive so he can kill them.

A shadow demon also haunts this room. In the round after the characters engage Rahadin, the demon leaps out and attacks the nearest character from behind.  
The character doesn't notice the demon, unless the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds the demon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. Both Rahadin and the shadow demon fight until slain.

A secret door is set into the north end of the west wall.

It can be pulled open to reveal a dusty, web-choked stair­ case of ancient, worn stone (area K79) that descends into darkness.

DUNGEON AND CATACOMBS

Refer to map 12 of the castle for areas K73 through K88.

K73. DUNGEON HALL

The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by way of the staircase to the east (area K21). Adjust as needed if the characters enter this hall from another direction.

The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water's surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the "thwick" of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.

For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trap­ door opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trap­ door when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.

When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the  
pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens).  
The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn't open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.

Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).

K74. NORTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.

A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. One of the cells is dimly lit.

The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. Light spills out of cell K74h.

A hinged door made up of 1-inch-thick rusted iron bars spaced 4 inches apart, with horizontal crossbars spaced 6 inches apart, closes off each cell. Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves' tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.

A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.

Strahd visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here. He can enter a cell by entering mist form.

Clinging to the bars of this otherwise empty cell is the rotting corpse of a male half-elf dressed in leather armor.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.

Treasure. A search of the corpse yields a sheathed longsword and two belt pouches, one containing five gemstones (50 gp each) and the other containing a po­ tion ofheroism.

Secret Door. A secret door is:s fe.et up from the floor on the north wall of this cell. Tlie secret door can't be opened from this side without.the use of a knock spell or similar magic. Behind the secret door 1s a chute of pol­ ished black marble that slants upward (area K82).

K74F. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K74G. GRAY OOZE

Clinging to the floor of this cell is a gray ooze that at­ tacks anything that enters. While underwater, the ooze is effectively invisible. 

K74H. LOST SWORD

A glowing blade can be seen beneath the water near the back of the cell.

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.

Treasure. The source of the underwater glow is a sen­ tient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wis­ dom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmit­ ting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.

, Alawfulgoodcreaturecanattuneitselftothesword in 1 minute.  
While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the crusader's mantle spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.

K75. SOUTH DUNGEON

The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.

A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water  
is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. From one of the cells, you hear a gruff voice ask, "Who's there?"

The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. The voice comes from one of the southernmost cells (area K75a).

K75A. PRISONER

A strong young man clutches the bars of his cell while struggling to keep his teeth from chattering. His clothes are shredded, and he is soaked from head to toe.

The man is Emil Toranescu, a werewolf with 72 hit points. He claims to be a resident of Vallaki who was chased by dire wolves to the castle. He begs the charac­ ters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.

In truth, Strahd locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his werewolf pack (see chapter 15). Anxious to prove his worth to Strahd, Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn't turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika (see chapter 15, area Z7). In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the charac­ ters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.

K75B. FORGOTTEN TREASURE

Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting be­ neath their feet.

Treasure. Scattered across the floor of this cell are 2,100 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.

K75c. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75D. DEAD DWARF

This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73. The skeletal remains of a dwarf fighter lie at the bottom of the cell, enclosed in ru�ted plate armor. The dwarf's nonmagical but usable battleax� lies i:iearby.

K75e. EMPTY CELL
This cell contains nothing of interest.

K75F. DEAD WIZARD

Shackled to the back wall of this cell is an emaciated fig­ ure in a blue robe, its spindly arms spread wide and its head tilted forward. Long, gray hair hangs down in front of the dead man's face.

The skeletal figure is all that remains of a human wiz­ ard whom Strahd captured and slowly bled to death. Flesh still clings to the wizard's bones, and puncture marks from the vampire's fangs are visible on the wiz­ ard's neck.

K75G. HANGING BARD

Pounded into the roof of this cell is a rusted iron pulley, strung through which is a rope that is tied to one of the crossbeams of the barred door. Dangling upside down from the pulley is a man, flabby and stout of build, in tight-fitting leather armor. His boots are bound with rope just below the pulley, his fleshy hands are tied behind his back, and his head is underwater. He isn't moving.

Strahd had this human bard suspended from the ceiling as a test to see how long he could keep his head above water. The man weakened and drowned. On the floor of the cell, below the hanging corpse, is a smashed lyre.

K75H. EMPTY CELL

This cell contains nothing of interest.

K76. TORTURE CHAMBER

Dark, low shapes thrust up out of the still, brackish water that fills this fifty-foot-square room, the ceiling of which is festooned with hanging chains that look like thick, black web strands. A balcony set into the north wall over­ looks the room and has two large thrones atop it, with a red velvet curtain behind them.

The ceiling is 17 feet above the surface of the \\'.ater, which is 3 feet deep. The balcony to the north stands 7 feet above the water's surface, IO.feet.above· the floor.
If the characters approach the "dark, low shapes" in the water read:

The dark shapes in the water are racks, iron maidens, stocks, and other instruments of torture. The skeletons of their last victims lie within them, their jaws seemingly frozen open in silent screams.

As soon as one or more characters move more than 10 feet into the room, six Strahd zombies rise slowly out of the water, their slime-gray arms clawing upward through the water as they attack.

K77. OBSERVATION BALCONY ·

Two large, wooden thrones rest on this balcony. Behind the thrones hangs a red velvet curtain thirty feet long. The ceiling here is ten feet high.

The room continues behind the curtain an additional 10 feet to a wall that has a door in its center.

K78. BRAZIER ROOM

This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat. The rim of the brazier is carved with seven cup-shaped inden­ tations spaced evenly around the circumference. Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.

Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.

Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep al­ coves facing each other. The brazier sits between them.

The two statues are iron golems. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circum­ stances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the "Development" section that follows).

The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the·hourglass is-reduced to O hif points, its glass shatt!!fS, ·causing the sand within it to fall to the floor.
