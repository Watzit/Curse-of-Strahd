K47. P ORTRAIT OF STRAHD

You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty

feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.

An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet pene­ trating gaze.

The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It at­ tacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it.
Underneath the rug is a bare stone .floor.

The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on.a.side and as thick as··the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring buiit into the si. de opposit ethe hinges.

The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can't be removed without de­ stroying it.

If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the guardian por­ trait (see appendix D) attacks.

This spiraling staircase is dark and dusty.

II This stairway rises from area K47, past area K54,

to area K57.

K49. LOUNGE

As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.

The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in  
the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd's mood improves.  
If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of mel­ ancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the cata­ combs (area K84) with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

The books in the bookcase have no value and aren't much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include Embalming: The Lost Art, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, Castle Building 101, and Goats of the Balinok Mountains.

TREASURE

On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a plat­ inum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pen­ dant (worth 750 gp).

K50. GUEST ROOM

A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four cor­ ner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.

There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of ld4 Baro­ vian witches from area K56. They try to subdue the party with sleep spells. A witch retreats to area K56

if wounded.

K51. CLOSET

This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.

The cloak is ordinary. The witches in area K56 placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secn,t trapdoor in. the ceiling.
