K47. P ORTRAIT OF STRAHD

You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty

feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.

An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet pene­ trating gaze.

The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It at­ tacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it.
Underneath the rug is a bare stone .floor.

The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on.a.side and as thick as··the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring buiit into the si. de opposit ethe hinges.
