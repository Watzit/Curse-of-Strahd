K47. P ORTRAIT OF STRAHD

You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty

feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.

An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet pene­ trating gaze.

The ornate rug is actually a rug of smothering. It at­ tacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it.
Underneath the rug is a bare stone .floor.

The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on.a.side and as thick as··the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring buiit into the si. de opposit ethe hinges.

The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can't be removed without de­ stroying it.

If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the guardian por­ trait (see appendix D) attacks.

K48. 0FFSTAIR  
This spiraling staircase is dark and dusty.

II This stairway rises from area K47, past area K54,

to area K57.

K49. LOUNGE

As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.

The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in  
the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd's mood improves.  
If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of mel­ ancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the cata­ combs (area K84) with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

The books in the bookcase have no value and aren't much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include Embalming: The Lost Art, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, Castle Building 101, and Goats of the Balinok Mountains.

TREASURE

On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a plat­ inum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pen­ dant (worth 750 gp).

K50. GUEST ROOM

A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four cor­ ner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.

There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of ld4 Baro­ vian witches from area K56. They try to subdue the party with sleep spells. A witch retreats to area K56

if wounded.

K51. CLOSET

This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.

The cloak is ordinary. The witches in area K56 placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secn,t trapdoor in. the ceiling.

The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Lo­ cating the trapdoor doesn't enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs. Once it has been found, the trap­ door can be opened by pulling on the hook, or it can be unlocked by someone using thieves' tools, a knock spell, or similar magic. It swings down when unlocked

K52. SMOKESTACK

Jutting from the steeply sloping rooftop of the castle, a spindly smokestack, five feet in diameter at the top, rises thirty feet above the roof's peak. Smoke belches from its iron-pronged capstone.

The chimney leads down 60 feet to the blazing fireplace in area K37. A creature that starts its turn in the chim­ ney takes 3 (ld6) fire damage.

K53. ROOFTOP

Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping rooftop. Flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof's end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the courtyard some one hundred thirty feet below.

If a character tries to traverse the rooftop, read:

Some of the ancient roof tiles slide easily underfoot, eas­ ily dropping into the fog-shrouded darkness. Each falling tile resounds with a hollow click as it hits the flagstones of the parapet or courtyard below.

A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acro­ batics) check to traverse the roof. The check succeeds automatically if the character crawls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides off the edge of the roof ans falls 40 feet to the castle parapet (area K46).

K54. FAMILIAR ROOM

The low ceiling of this twenty-foot-square room presses down on you. Torn and broken couches lie in heaps, hap­ hazardly strewn about. Deep claw marks cover the hard­ wood furniture, and the once lush upholstery has been sliced to shreds. From the dark shadows amid the rubble, three pairs of green eyes stare back at you.

The three c.ats are familiars ·of-the•lit��es in ai,ea .�so..

K55. ELEMENT ROOM

Heavy beams support the ceiling of this large room, the outer wall of which curves to follow the shape of the tower. Dim light filters into the room through the steel lattice squares of two leaded glass windows. Several ta­ bles stand throughout the room, weighed down by stacks of glass jars and bottles, all of them bearing labels.

The labeled glass containers hold various elements that the witches use in their fell concoctions and rituals. The labels identify such items as "Eye of Newt," "Hair of Bat," "Snail Hearts," and "Frog's Breath." There are no magic potions among the bottles and jars.

The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They are currently locked from the in­ side. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

Characters who search the room spot numerous boot prints in the dust, as well as a short trail in the dust on the floor, leading from the northeast corner of the room to the easternmost door. It looks like something heavy was dragged across the floor toward the doorway.

There is a secret trapdoor in the northeast corner

of the floor. Because of the trail through the dust, the trapdoor can be found without an ability check. Tapping or knocking on the trapdoor three times releases a hidden latch, causing the trapdoor to swing down. Area KSl lies below. (There's no ability check that will let the characters figure out the trick to opening the door. They can get that information from the witches, or perhaps by using a divination spell or similar magic.)

K56. CAULDRON

Characters who stand outside the door to this room can smell a pungent odor coming from within.

If the witches in this room have not been warned that the characters are coming, the characters can hear their horrid cackling. If the characters open the door slightly, they witness the scene described below:

Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are several gaunt women in soiled black robes. These witches sit hunched on tall wooden stools, their tangled hair tucked under black, pointed hats. They take turns tossing ingredients into the cauldron, uttering fell incantations, and cackling maniacally.

: If the 'witches know the characters are coming, read the ·following text instead:

Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppres­ sive room. Surrounding the cauldron are seven tall wooden stools.

The Barovian witches (see appendix D) that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd's service  
in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are pres­ ent when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in area KSO. If  
the witches are expecting the characters, they cast in­ visibility spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using alter self

When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word ("Gorah!"), it magi­ cally heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron's property has been used, the cauldron can't be activated again until the next dawn.

Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor  
in area KSS.

TREASURE

Each witch carries a potion of healing that she made herself. There is a 30 percent chance that a potion has "gone bad," in which case it's actually a potion ofpoison.

Not visible from the entrance is a small table behind the cauldron on which sits an opened spellbook, seem­ ingly on the verge of falling apart. The book is evil. Any non-evil creature that touches it or starts its turn with the book in its possession takes 5 (ldlO) psychic dam­ age. The book contains the following spells:

1st level: burning hands, charm person, detect magic, find familiar, fog cloud, mage armor, protection from evil and good, ray ofsickness, sleep, Tasha's hideous laugh­ ter, unseen servant, witch bolt

2nd level: alter self, arcane lock, cloud ofdaggers, darkness, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock, misty step

K57. TOWER ROOF

The sixty-foot-diameter tower roof is rimmed with battle­ ments. A slender stone bridge with no railing spans the gap between this tower and the slightly taller tower to the north. To the east, the high tower of Ravenloft thrusts skyward with no apparent opening at this level. Black, boiling clouds hurl rain down from above.

The courtyard is 190 feet below, the roof of the keep 80 fe�t below. A stone railing encloses a stone spiral stair­ case _that descends into the tower.

K58. BRIDGE

A strong wind blows across this slender bridge of stone and masonry. The bridge's old iron railings have rusted away years ago, leaving the bridge without handholds.

K59. HIGH TOWER PEAK

MAP9

North Tower Peak

DOWN 50FEET TOMAPS

The bridge connects areas K20 and K57. The wind isn't strong enough to knock creatures off the bridge, but a creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet onto the roof of the keep.

DROPS3IOFEET TOMAP12

K59. HIGH TOWER PEAK

If the characters climb the stairs to reach the tower peak, read:

The spiral staircase finally ends at a five-foot-wide stone walkway that circles the shaft. In the center of the tower's highest floor, a fifteen-foot-diameter ·hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself. Cold air rushes up out of the shaft, sending a chill through you. Arrow slits line the walls, and aging beams support a steep, cone-shaped roof. One beam and part of the roof have fallen away, leaving a gaping hole open to the stormy sky.

The hole in the floor forms the mouth of an enclosed shaft (area K18a) that descends 450 feet to the castle catacombs (area K84).

PIDLWICK II

Hiding in the rafters is Pidlwick II (see appendix D). A character spots Pidlwick II with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score that meets or exceeds its Dexterity (Stealth) check. If Pidlwick II is spotted, read:

Something lurks among the rafters-a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack­ o'-lantern.

Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool's costume, Pidlwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidlwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.

If the characters see Pidlwick II in bright light, read:

It's obvious that you're looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears.
