Refer to map 3 of the castle for areas K7 through K24.

K7. ENTRY  
Read the following text if the characters approach from

the courtyard (area Kl):

The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.

If one or more characters approach from area Kl and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:

The doors in front of you sud.denly swi�g open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.

If the characters approach from area K8 and have not yet visited this area, read: 

"A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle."

If the characters enter from either direction, read:

"Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight."

If anyone except Strahd enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don't attack characters who enter this area from area Kl, heading east. The dragons are four red dragon wyrmlings, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.

K8. GREAT ENTRY  
Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the

vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputter­ ing torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shad­ ows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay.

The elf is Rahadin, the castle chamberlain (see appen­ dix D). He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (area KlO), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to area K72 by way of the South Tower Stair (area K21).

DEVELOPMENT

After all the characters leave this room, the eight gar­ goyles attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.
