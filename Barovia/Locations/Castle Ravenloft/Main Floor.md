Refer to map 3 of the castle for areas K7 through K24.

K7. ENTRY  
Read the following text if the characters approach from

the courtyard (area Kl):

The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.

If one or more characters approach from area Kl and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:

The doors in front of you sud.denly swi�g open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.

If the characters approach from area K8 and have not yet visited this area, read: 

"A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle."

If the characters enter from either direction, read:

"Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight."

If anyone except Strahd enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don't attack characters who enter this area from area Kl, heading east. The dragons are four red dragon wyrmlings, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.

K8. GREAT ENTRY

"Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. 

Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east.
To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones"

The southern hallway is described in area K9. The wide staircase leads up to area K19.

If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:

An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. "My master is expecting you, he says"

The elf is Rahadin, the castle chamberlain (see appendix D). He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (area KlO), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to area K72 by way of the South Tower Stair (area K21).

DEVELOPMENT

After all the characters leave this room, the eight gargoyles attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.

K9. GUESTS' HALL

Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.

The suit of armor standing in the alcove is merely a nor­ mal suit of plate armor that is well cared for.

The staircase leads down to area K61 and up to area K30. The double doors provide access to area KlO.

KlO. DINING HALL  
The first time the characters enter this room, read:

Three enormous crystal chandeliers brilliantly illuminate this magnificent chamber. Pillars of stone stand against dull white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delec­ table foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an am­ ber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.

At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceil­ ing mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.

The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like Strahd and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they're free to explore the castle. "Strahd" might talk about his family or shed light on the castle's history, but the illu­ sion provides no useful information about the castle's inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn't receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disap­ pears with a mocking laugh.

The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Fi­ nally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut ( but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, KB, and K9 have gone out.

The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A char­ acter who tries pushing various keys and pedals dis­ covers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area Kll. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can't be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.

The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.

Kll. SOUTH ARCHERS' POST

The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the north and west walls. Leaning against the walls are mir­ rors of various sizes, some as tall as a human and others small enough to fit in a backpack.

Each arrow slit is 21/2 feet tall and 4 inches wide. The framed mirrors (seventeen in all) used to hang on var­ ious walls of the castle. Strahd had them taken down and stored here.

A secret door in the east wall can be pulled open to re­ veal the back of the pipe organ in area KlO. Characters can't pass through the secret door while the organ is blocking it, and the organ can't be moved from this side.

Kl2. TURRET POST

A high, domed ceiling caps the thirty-foot-wide octago­ nal room before you. Frescoes faded with age adorn the ceiling, but their images are impossible to make out. Tall, thin arrow slits look out over the courtyard.

IEach arrow slit is 2'h feet tall and 4 inches wide.
