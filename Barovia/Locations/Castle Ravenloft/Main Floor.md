Refer to map 3 of the castle for areas K7 through K24.

K7. ENTRY  
Read the following text if the characters approach from the courtyard (area Kl):

_______
"The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors."
_______

If one or more characters approach from area Kl and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:

_______
"The doors in front of you suddenly swing open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music."
_______

If the characters approach from area K8 and have not yet visited this area, read: 

_______
"A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle."
_______

If the characters enter from either direction, read:

_______
"Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight."
_______

If anyone except [[Strahd]] enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don't attack characters who enter this area from area Kl, heading east. The dragons are four red dragon wyrmlings, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.

K8. GREAT ENTRY
________
"Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. 

Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones"
________

The southern hallway is described in area K9. The wide staircase leads up to area K19.

If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:

________
"An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. "My master is expecting you, he says""
_______

The elf is Rahadin, the castle chamberlain (see appendix D). He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (area KlO), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to area K72 by way of the South Tower Stair (area K21).

DEVELOPMENT

After all the characters leave this room, the eight gargoyles attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.

K9. GUESTS' HALL
_______
"Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armour, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall."
_______

The suit of armor standing in the alcove is merely a normal suit of plate armor that is well cared for.

The staircase leads down to area K61 and up to area K30. The double doors provide access to area K1O.

K10. DINING HALL  
The first time the characters enter this room, read:

_______
"Three enormous crystal chandeliers brilliantly illuminate this magnificent chamber. Pillars of stone stand against dull white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.

At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you."
_______

The figure is an illusion of [[Strahd]]. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like [[Strahd]] and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they're free to explore the castle. "[[Strahd]]" might talk about his family or shed light on the castle's history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle's inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn't receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.

The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut ( but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.

The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can't be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.

The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.

K11. SOUTH ARCHERS' POST
_____
"The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the north and west walls. Leaning against the walls are mirrors of various sizes, some as tall as a human and others small enough to fit in a backpack."
_____

Each arrow slit is 2 1/2 feet tall and 4 inches wide. The framed mirrors (seventeen in all) used to hang on various walls of the castle. [[Strahd]] had them taken down and stored here.

A secret door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal the back of the pipe organ in area K1O. Characters can't pass through the secret door while the organ is blocking it, and the organ can't be moved from this side.

K12. TURRET POST

"A high, domed ceiling caps the thirty-foot-wide octagonal room before you. Frescoes faded with age adorn the ceiling, but their images are impossible to make out. Tall, thin arrow slits look out over the courtyard."

Each arrow slit is 2 1/2 feet tall and 4 inches wide.

K13. TURRET POST ACCESS HALL
______
"This long, narrow corridor runs east to west. Cobwebs fill the hall, obstructing sight beyond a few feet."
______

K14. HALL OF FAITH
_____
"This grand hall is choked with dust and stretches into darkness ahead. Webs hang from the arched ceiling like drapes, and life-sized statues of knights line the hallway on both sides, their eyes seeming to watch you."
_____

The statues are harmless. Their moving eyes are a simple optical illusion.
Double doors stand at both ends of the hall. Above the doors leading to area K15 hangs a symbol of beaten bronze that looks like a rising or setting sun.

K15. CHAPEL
_______
"Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and board­ ed-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.

Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone plat­ form. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet."
_______

The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the Icon of Ravenloft and did not survive the attempt. See "Treasure" below for more information on the icon and Gustav's possessions.

A sculpted stone railing cordons off the upstairs balcony, which is described in area K28.

TREASURE

The statuette on the altar is an artifact called the Icon ofRavenloft (see appendix C). Any evil creature that touches the statuette must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The statuette is safe for all creatures to handle once it is no longer in contact with the altar.

Gustav's corpse wears a handsome, fur-lined black cloak embroidered with golden thread (worth 250 gp) and a suit of chain mail, both nonmagical. Gustav's black mace is a mace of terror.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the floor behind the altar.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is among the bats fluttering below the ceiling or he is standing at one end of the chapel-a dark shape in the vast hall.

K16. NORTH CHAPEL ACCESS

______
"This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and a staircase that rises to the west. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with muscular builds. Black shadows fall across their faces."
______

The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in area K29.

K17. SOUTH CHAPEL ACCESS
_______
"This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and the landing of a staircase to the west. To the left of the landing, the stairs curl down into darkness. To the right, the stairs climb into thick drapes of cobwebs. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with bright blades. Black shadows obscure their faces."
_______

The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area Kl5). The staircase to the west is described in area K18.

K18. HIGH TOWER STAIRCASE
_____
"The large flagstones of this spiralling staircase lead up and down around a twenty-foot-wide stone core. Cobwebs fill the staircase, making it difficult to see even the ceiling. Heavy beams sag overhead from centuries of supporting weight."
_____

The staircase starts at area K84 and spirals upward around a central shaft (area K18a), climbing 300 feet to the top of the high tower (area K59).

A recently constructed masonry, wall blocks the staircase 10 feet below the landing west of area K17. A chink in this wall allows gas (or a vampire in gaseous form) to pass from one side of the wall to the other. A character who inspects the wall closely can spot the chink with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The wall is too sturdy for characters to knock down, but they can create a hole wide enough to crawl through in 1 hour, or reduce the entire wall to a pile of masonry bricks and rubble in 2 hours.

Thirty feet below the masonry wall and 50 feet above the foot of the steps, a small crack has formed in the outer wall of the stairwell. The crack is 1/2 inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to the castle's wine cellar (area K63). Characters can notice the crack automatically as they climb or descend the stairs. Widening the crack enough to squeeze through the wall requires major excavation and would take several days.

The shaft that these stairs wrap around (area K18a) runs vertically from area K59 to area K84 without any holes or obstructions. The inner wall of the stairwell, between the staircase and the shaft, is solid.

K18A. HIGH TOWER SHAFT

Characters can access this 10-foot-diameter, 390-foot tall stone shaft from the top or the bottom of the high tower (areas K59 and K84, respectively).

The shaft is dark and choked with cobwebs. A rushing wind causes the webs to stir. Climbing the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber's kit, since there are few handholds.

The bats in the catacombs (area K84) fly up the shaft at night, exiting [[Castle Ravenloft]] through various arrow slits and holes in the tower's peak (area K59). After feeding, they return by the same route.

K19. GRAND LANDING
_______
"Massive stairs rise to a landing twenty feet wide by forty feet long. Stone arches support a ceiling covered with frescoes twenty feet overhead. The frescoes depict armored knights on horseback, their finer features faded beyond recognition.

Dust floats in the air here. At each end of the south wall, a staircase rises into darkness. Between the staircases are twin alcoves, each one containing a standing suit of armor covered with dark stains. Each suit of armor clutches a mace, the "business end" of which is shaped like a dragon's head. Words engraved on the arches above the suits of armor have been scratched out."
_______

Both staircases on the south wall climb to area K25. The massive stairs lead down to area K8. Anyone who crosses in front of the alcoves along the south wall activates the suits of armor.

Both suits of armor are mechanical traps, each one activated by a pressure plate hidden in the floor in front of its alcove. A character who searches for. traps in one of these locations notices both pressure plates with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. 

When 40 or more pounds of �eight are placed on a pressure plate, the suit of armour nearest to that plate springs forward, flailing its arms and wielding its mace. Any creature standing on a pressure plate when its trap triggers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning dam· age from the flailing armor. After leaping out and attacking, the armor retracts. The pressure plate resets after 1 minute, after which its armor trap can be triggered again.

The suits of armor act much like metal puppets - a little joke intended to spook visitors more than damage them. A pressure plate can be disabled by a character who uses thieves' tools and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A trap can also be disabled by destroying its suit of armor, which has AC 18, 5 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.

K20. HEART OF SORROW
_____
"A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you. A spiral staircase rises slowly into darkness, hugging the outer wall. In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down."
_____

The staircase in the center of the floor (area K20a) leads down to area K71.

The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (shown on map 4), from which an open archway leads to area K13. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to area K34.

The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (shown on map 5), with archways that lead to areas K45 and K46, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower's heart (shown on map 8). The staircase wraps around the heart, ending at the top of the tower (area K60).

THE HEART

The tower, including the spiral staircase, is alive. When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:

______
"As you step onto the spiral staircase, a reddish light flares high overhead, then settles into a dull, pulsing red glow. You now see the full immensity of this tower. The spiral staircase circles up the tower's full height. The tower, sixty feet wide at its base, becomes narrower as it climbs. At the pinnacle of the hollow tower, a large crystal heart pulsates with red light. Above the heart, the stairs continue upward."
______

Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart's initiative count doesn't change.

The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow's initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart's turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie prone on the stairs succeed automatically.

The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to O hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.

[[Strahd]] and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage [[Strahd]] takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and [[Strahd]] takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of [[Strahd]]. Casting dispel magic on it has no effect.  

Animated Halberds. Mounted on the walls along the section of staircase nearest the heart are ten animated halberds; use the stat block for the flying sword in the Monster Manual, but increase each halberd's damage to ldlO + 1 and reduce its AC to 15. The halberds attack any creature that threatens the Heart of Sorrow.

Vampire Spawn. [[Strahd]] senses if any damage is done to the Heart of Sorrow and sends four vampire spawn to destroy those responsible. These vampire spawn are former adventurers whom [[Strahd]] defeated long ago. They use their Spider Climb feature to scuttle along the tower walls and arrive in 3 rounds.

K20A. TOWER HALL STAIR

This stairway connects areas K20 and K71.

K21. SOUTH TOWER STAIR
_____
"Fluttering torches in iron sconces illuminate this spiral staircase. A chill wind rushes down the circling stairway, seeming to kill the very heat of the torches."
_____

These stairs start at area K7 3 and. go up through areas K61, K9, K30, and K35 before ending at area K47.

K22. NORTH ARCHERS' POST
______
"The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the walls."
______

Each arrow slit is 2Y2 feet tall and 4 inches wide.

K23. SERVANTS' ENTRANCE
______
"Dim light filters in through a dust-caked window in the east wall. A door next to the window leads to the castle's northeast courtyard. 

Everything in this room is coated with dust, including a large, heavy table in the center of the floor. A thick book lies open on a desk, with an inkwell and a quill next to it. There is a broken door in the north wall, and a staircase in the south wall plunges into darkness. On each side of the staircase, a skeletal figure draped in gleaming chain mail stands sagging at attention, holding a rusty halberd."
______

The skeletons, which were assembled by Cyrus Belview (see area K62), are held together with wire frames and hung on pegs. They pose no threat.

The staircase descends to area K62. The east door leading to the courtyard is swollen in its frame and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The north door is cracked and hangs loose on its hinges; beyond it lies another dust-filled chamber (area K24).

The ancient book is weathered and brittle, but the ink in the well is fresh. At the top of each page is scribed the message "Please register for your own convenience and that of your next of kin." The book is more than half-filled with names, all of them illegible.

K24. SERVANTS' QUARTERS
______
"Broken furniture and torn cloth are strewn about this twenty-by-forty-foot room. Dim light comes from a pair of dirt-caked windows in the northeast corner. A narrow staircase with no railing ascends along the north wall."
______
The stairs lead to area K34.
