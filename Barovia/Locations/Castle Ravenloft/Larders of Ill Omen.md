K61. ELEVATOR TRAP

See area K31 and the accompanying Elevator Trap diagram before running this encounter.
______
"This dusty, ten-foot-wide, thirty-foot-long corridor has a flat ceiling ten feet overhead. To the south, a web-filled stairway spirals down into darkness. The north end of the hall ends at a wooden door."
______
This hallway contains an elevator trap, triggered when at least 400 pounds of pressure is applied to the 10-foot square section of floor in the center of the hall (marked T on the map), or when the lever in area K31 is raised. A party of adventurers moving in close formation down the hall is certainly heavy enough to trigger the trap.

A character who searches for traps while crossing the hall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects seams in the floor, walls, and ceiling that suggest that the middle section isn't attached to. the rest of the hall. A character.who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ( Investigation) check discerns that the trap can't be disarmed from this location..

The middle 10-foot section of the hall is a cleverly hidden elevator compartment, open to the north and south so that it appears to be part of the passageway. When the trap is sprung, two steel portcullises drop from the ceiling at lightning speed to seal off the compartment, trapping within those creatures that triggered the trap. An instant later, the closed-off elevator is propelled up the western half of a 20-foot wide 170 foot-tall shaft (area K31a) to the sounds.of turning gears and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas fills the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious as though affected by a sleep spell.

At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, filling the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverises anything in the space where it comes to rest.

Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can't be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.

All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including unconscious ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath area K47. Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occupants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other actions. Unconscious ones can do nothing.

A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens downward.

Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.

The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in area K31 is moved to the "down" position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft. When the elevator reaches the bottom, its portcullises rise again.

DEVELOPMENT

The sound of the elevator moving can be heard through, out the castle. Characters who-are. trapped or asleep in the elevator compartment.are easy prey for [[Strahd]], who can reach them by way of the trapdoor in area K47

K62. SERVANTS' HALL
_____
"This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you."
_____
The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a mongrel-folk (see appendix D) and [[Strahd]]'s faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck's webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.

The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in area K60. The wooden pendant is a hag eye given to Cyrus by the night hag Morgantha (see chapter 6), so that she could spy on [[Strahd]]. Cyrus doesn't know that the necklace is magical. See the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Manual for information about the hag eye.

Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their "room in the tower" (area K49). If the characters aren't sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.

If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to area K61 and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (area K31), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he's still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to area K47 and either leads the characters to area K49 or if they're unconscious, drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that "the master will be along shortly," Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen (area K65).

If the characters don't go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in area K65. If the characters take his key, he screams, "The master will not be pleased!" and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check is enough to make him divulge the key's purpose, the location of the iron chest' and the chest's contents.

When he isn't being threatened, Cyrus giggles to himself from time to time for no clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at (he most.inopportune moments. 

Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to area K23.

Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcullis that bars the way to area K63. (If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for area K63.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

The double doors at the west end of the hall are made of heavy planks banded with steel. They open into area K67.

K63. WINE CELLAR
______
"Arched frames of stone form a low, wet ceiling over this wine cellar. Great casks line the walls, their bands rusting and their contents long since spilled onto the floor. A few hungry rats make their home here, but upon your sudden arrival, they retreat to the shadows."
______

The rats are harmless. Cyrus Belview (see area K62) treats them like pets.

Characters who search the room find a crack at the southern end of the west wall. The crack is half an inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to area K18.

WINE CASKS

Each of the twelve large casks here rests on its side in a heavy wooden brace. Three casks stand against the north wall, six against the east wall, and three against the south wall. Decorative lettering is burned into the top of each cask, showing the winery name-[[the Wizard of Wines]]-and the name of the wine in the cask.

Northern Casks. All three of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine's name is Champagne du le Stomp.

Eastern Casks. Five of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Red Dragon Crush. Lining the interior of the sixth one is a patch of yellow mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A character who inspects the cask closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check sees yellow mold in the cracks between the planks of the cask. If this cask is smashed open, the yellow mold releases a cloud of spores.

Southern Casks. Two of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Purple Grapemash No. 3. The middle one is home to a purplish black pudding that bursts forth if the cask is broken open.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside one of the empty casks along the north wall, hidden there by Cyrus Belview.

K64. GUARDS' STAIR l

The long, hollow sigh of the wind breathes a semblance of life into this otherwise featureless staircase.

The stairway starts at area K68 and goes up past area K13 to area K46.

K65. KITCHEN

A horrible odor of decay fills this steaming hot room. A huge pot bubbles over a blazing fire pit in the center of the room, its green, muddy contents churning. The far wall is lined with pegs, hanging from which are numerous large cooking implements-some of which could easily double as implements of torture.

If a character looks into the pot, three human zombies rise up from the bubbling depths and attack. The zombies are slowly being boiled to death, and each has only 13 hit points remaining. If Cyrus Belview (see area K62) is present when the zombies attack, he grabs a heavy club and tries to beat them back into the pot. Cyrus explains that he just isn't the cook he used to be, and his meals tend to get out of hand these days.

K66. BUTLER'S UARTERS

This twenty-foot-square room is filled wall to wall with clutter. A long, sagging bed sits to one side under a huge faded tapestry that depicts [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Dusty lanterns sit in various places, and bright curtains are draped haphazardly about the room. Thousands of pieces of junk cover the Aoor. Broken swords, crumpled shields, and helmets lie in piles all about.

Cyrus Belview (see area K62) uses this room as his lair. There is nothing of value here.

If Cyrus is with the party, the characters notice that he is caressing their equipment and chuckling to himself. Cyrus has been salvaging equipment from dead adventurers for years. He looks forward to adding to his collection after [[Strahd]] gets through with the characters.

K67. HALL OF BONES

Once a mess hall for the castle guards, this room is now desecrated ground (see "Wilderness Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
____
"Dark stains cover the floor of this area. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Replacing them are furnishings made entirely of human bones.

The walls and the twenty-foot-high vaulted ceiling are a sickly yellow color, not because of faded or timeworn plaster but because they are adorned with bones and skulls arranged in a morbidly decorative fashion, giving the room a cathedral-like quality. Four enormous mounds of bones occupy the corners of this ossuary, and garlands of skulls extend from these mounds to a chandelier of bones that hangs from the ceiling above a long table constructed of bones in the center of the room.

Ten chairs made of bones and festooned with decorative skulls surround the table, resting atop which is an ornate, bowl-shaped vessel made of yet more bones.

The doors to the north and south are sheathed in bone, but the steel-banded double doors in the center of the east wall are not. Above these eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon."
____
Cyrus Belview (see area K62) created this enormous work of art out of the bones of dead servants and slain adventurers. It has taken him many years to complete it. The bones and skulls are held together with gray mortar and white paste. The dark stains on the floor are old bloodstains, caused here when [[Strahd]] _hunted down and killed the remainder of his castle guards.

The dragon skull mounted above the eastern doors belonged to Argynvost ( see chapter 7) a silver dragon that was killed in the valley by [[Strahd]] and his army before the founding of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. The skull weighs 250 pounds.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT  
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying on the bone table. If your card reading indicates' an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is sitting comfortably at one end of the table, holding the skull of a long-dead foe.

K68. GUARDS' RUN

This ten-foot-wide arched corridor is cold and moist. The cold seems to emanate from an open archway in the west wall.

The archway leads to area K69. A door at the north end of the hall opens into area K67. To the south, the hallway ends at the foot of a staircase (area K64) that spirals upward.

K69. GUARDS' QUARTERS

Sickly, yellow lichen covers the ceiling of this cold, damp, ten-foot-wide passage running east and west. Opening off both sides of this passage are ten-foot-square alcoves that contain rotting cots, rags, and the skeletal remains of castle guards. A deathly silence fills the hall.

The yellow lichen is harmless. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall, ten human skeletons leap from the alcoves and attack.

K70. KINGSMEN HALL

This thirty-foot-square room is a shambles. Scattered furniture lies in heaps near the walls. Broken bones lie scattered amid crumpled and crushed plate armor. Shields and swords jut from the walls as if driven into them by some tremendous force.

Two doors stand opposite one another in the center of the north wall and the south wall. A dark archway leads out through the east wall.

After [[Strahd]] was transformed into a vampire, several of the castle guards retreated to this room, but [[Strahd]] caught them and slaughtered them in a brutal show of violence. Removing one of the shields or swords from the wall requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. None of the items found here are valuable.

K71. KINGSMEN QUARTERS

This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are four ten-foot-square alcoves cluttered with rotting cots and dirty rags. The ceilings here are covered with yellow lichen.

TREASURE

Three of the alcoves contain nothing of value. A loose flagstone in the southeast alcove covers a hidden cub­ byhole in the floor, in which is hidden a moldy sack containing 150 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of [[Strahd]] von Zarovich stamped on them. A character who searches the alcove can find the loose flagstone with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

K72. CHAMBERLAIN'S OFFICE

This shadowy room is in perfect order. A great table stands here with its chair, inkwell, and quill set carefully in place. Lances, swords, and shields that bear the Baro­ vian crest are hung neatly on the dark, oak-paneled walls.

If he has not been defeated elsewhere, Rahadin (see appendix D) is here, waiting for the characters to arrive so he can kill them.

A shadow demon also haunts this room. In the round after the characters engage Rahadin, the demon leaps out and attacks the nearest character from behind.  
The character doesn't notice the demon, unless the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds the demon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. Both Rahadin and the shadow demon fight until slain.

A secret door is set into the north end of the west wall.

It can be pulled open to reveal a dusty, web-choked stair­ case of ancient, worn stone (area K79) that descends into darkness.
