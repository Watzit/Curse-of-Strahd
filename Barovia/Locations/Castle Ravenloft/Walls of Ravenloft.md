Refer to map 2 of the castle for areas K1 through K6.

K1. FRONT COURTYARD

As the characters enter the castle, the weather worsens. Dismal rain starts to fall, becoming a torrent within the hour. Lightning routinely lights the sky, followed by peals of thunder that make the castle shudder.

_____
"Thick, cold fog swirls in this courtyard. Sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep's open main doors. Warm light spills out of the entrance, flooding the courtyard. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame."
_____

The walls that enclose the courtyard are 90 feet high. The dark towers of the castle rise even higher. Doors in the gate towers on each side of the tunnel entrance are shut against the rain, and a howling wind rushes through the courtyard.

The open main doors to the keep lead to area K7. The large, shattered window overlooking the main entrance is 50 feet above the courtyard and leads to area K25. No light can be seen through the great window.

GATE TOWERS

Each outer gate tower has an ironbound door with a built-in lock.

Characters who enter a gate tower find themselves on a flag�tone floor with a hollow tower stretching high above them, The mechanisms for raising and lowering the drawbridge and portcullis fill both gate towers. The latch mechanism in each tower is magically activated by a word that only [[Strahd]] knows. It can also be activated with a successful casting of dispel magic (DC 14). Neither the drawbridge nor the portcullis will move until both latches are activated.

K2. CENTER COURT GATE  
Two gates, one north of the keep and one to the south,

prevent easy access to what lies beyond them.

A massive wall juts out to connect the outer walls of the castle with the keep. A twenty-foot-wide, twenty-foot-tall archway offers passage through the connecting wall but is blocked by a rusting iron portcullis.

The portcullis is unlocked and can be lifted with a suc­ cessful DC 15 Strength check. It can also be opened with a command word that only [[Strahd]] and Cyrus Bel­ view (area K62) know. Unless the portcullis is wedged or propped open, it falls back into place once it is let go.

K3. SERVANTS' COURTYARD

This courtyard northeast of the keep is enclosed by tow­ ering walls. A stone carriage house with hinged wooden doors stands silent in the corner where the outer walls meet. Across from the carriage house, a slender wooden door reinforced with iron bands leads into the keep.

The carriage house is described in area K4. The wooden door, which leads to area K23, is swollen and stuck in its frame. A character can shoulder open the stuck door with a successful DC 10 Strength check.

K4. CARRIAGE HOUSE  
IRead the following text if the characters open the car­

riage house doors:

The double doors swing open to reveal a sleek, black car- riage fitted with glass windows and brass lanterns.

K5. CHAPEL GARDEN. ...."' .·

·,·.

At the back of the keep, behind towering buttresses and tall, boarded-up stained-glass windows, a small garden struggles to survive. Small flowers press skyward against the gloom. A pair of large iron gates blocks the way to some kind of overlook.

The large iron gates squeal loudly on rusted hinges when opened. Beyond them lies area K6.
K6. OVERLOOK

Dark clouds overhead drizzle constantly. A flagstone avenue passes between empty outbuildings, leading to a stone-paved overlook. The overlook has a low stone wall adorned with outward-facing gargoyle carvings.

If a character peers over the balcony, read:

A flash of lightning illuminates the dismal village of Baro­ via, its rooftops visible above a smothering blanket of fog one thousand feet below.

If a character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher peers over the wall, add:

Underneath the platform on which you stand, about one hundred feet down, a stone construction protrudes from the cliff face. Three dirt-caked windows are set into it.

The windows are so dirty as to be opaque, although a character within reach of one can scrape the dirt away and see a dusty tomb beyond (area K88). Characters who try to reach the windows from the overlook must descend 110 feet and move 20 feet back under the plat­ form. This descent can't be accomplished without the aid of magic or the use of a climber's kit.

Anyone who falls from the overlook plummets 1,000 feet.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is looking out over the balcony.
