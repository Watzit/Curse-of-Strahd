ROOMSOFWEEPING

Refer to map 5 of the castle for. area:sK35 through K46.

K35. GUARDIAN VERMIN
______
"A door of delicately engraved steel stands at the west end of this short, dark hallway. Intricate details stand out clearly on the door's surface. The door seems to shine with a light of its own, untouched by time. Flanking the door are two alcoves in shadow. A dark, vaguely man-shaped figure stands in each alcove."
______

The dark figures are four swarms ofrats piled atop one another to form manlike shapes (two swarms per alcove). These rats are under [[Strahd]]'s control and attack anyone that tries to move through this area.

The steel door is engraved with images of a human king in armor astride a horse, a majestic range of mountains and shooting stars in the background. Tiny figures of people and wolves frame the image.

K36. DINING HALL OF THE COUNT
_____
"Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table, a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs."
_____

The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of [[Strahd]]. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:

_____
"Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward. Scattered about the floor are chunks of the moldy cake, as if something had burst out of it."
_____

There are two explanations for the burst cake and broken window. Choose the one you think is creepier:

-   Strahd smashes the cake and breaks the window to make the characters think something terrible has escaped and is now stalking them.

-   [[Strahd]]'s hate assumes a corporeal form bursts out of the cake (the symbol of Sergei and [[Tatyana]]'s love), and escapes through the window. "[[Strahd]]'s hate" has the statistics of an invisible stalker and tries to kill whichever character is carrying the groom figurine.

The room has wooden doors in the north and west walls, and an ornate steel door in the east wall (see area K35 for details).
 
The harp stands 6 1/2 feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses. Its taut strings are made of gut.

A character who plays the harp and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check does well enough to summon the ghost of Pidlwick, a short little man dressed as a fool, with a tiny jingling bell at the end of his pointy dunce cap. He asks, "Why have you sum­ moned me from beyond the grave?" Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, "In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest." If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, "Pidlwick." If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, "I fell down the stairs." If Pidlwick II (see area K59) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, "He pushed me down the stairs."

With nothing more to add, the ghost of Pidlwick fades away and doesn't appear again. If the characters attack the ghost, it attacks them in turn.

TREASURE

The lute, though old and covered in dust, has survived the passage of time. It is a magic instrument ofthe bards called a Doss lute.

K37. STUDY
_____
"A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug.  

In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully ren­ dered portrait. It is an exact likeness of lreena Kolyana."
_____

This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.

The painting above the fireplace depicts [[Tatyana]], a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. [[Strahd]] commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that [[Ireena]] Kolyana looks exactly like [[Tatyana]] is proof to [[Strahd]] that both women were born with the same soul.

The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for. anyone to reach the secret door safely. Otherwise, a creature that enters the fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. 

Until someone takes an action to douse the flames on the creature, it takes 5 (1d10) fire 
damage at the start of each of its turns. (The fire damage is cumulative with the damage from standing in the fireplace.)
The secret door provides access to area K38.

TREASURE
The real treasure here is [[Strahd]]'s collection of books- over one thousand unique tomes in all. The collection is worth 80,000 gp. Transporting it would be a challenge.

Roll a d12 and consult the following table to determine the subject matter of a randomly chosen book.

TELEPORT DESTINATION

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in front of the painting of [[Tatyana]].

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is resting on the mantelpiece under the portrait of [[Tatyana]].

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is sitting back in one of the over­ stuffed chairs, staring into the fire.

K38. FALSE TREASURY

Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evi­ dence of great workmanship.

Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton's right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.

The coins scattered around the trapped chest total 50

gp, 100 sp, and 2,000.cp.The chest weighs40 pounds and is unlocked.

SECRET DOORS
This room i,s cpncealed behind two secret doors.
The seeret .door. to the west is set into the back wall ... ; o( the·fueplace'.(area K37) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple Jocking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It's pos­ sible that a character might open this secret door inad­ vertently by lifting the poker in area K37. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

The secret door at the northern end of the east wall

is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton's hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Re­ moving the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

K39. HALL OF WEBS 

This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.
The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.

Most of the hall is full of giant spider webs (see "Dun­ geon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk be­ coming stuck.

SECRET DOORS

At the west end of the hall are two secret doors.

The secret door on the west wall can't be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a knock spell). See area K38 for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from area K38, it closes and locks behind them if they don't take measures to prop it open.

A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door can be pulled open to reveal area K3lb.

K40. BELFRY

You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.

The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long "GONG." That sound causes five giant spiders to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are at­ tacked or if the bell is sounded.

Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider webs (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environ­ ments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.

At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.

K41. TREASURY

This octagonal vault is free of dust and cobwebs. The domed ceiling forty feet above is painted black and spar­ kles with a display of stars in unfamiliar constellations. Barely contained within this vault is a square tower, twenty feet on a side and thirty feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlemented roof.

The domed ceiling is coated with dry ·pitch. The ."star. s" are shards of glowing crystal embedded fn the pitch, each one as bright as a candle flame. Thanks to the starry "night sky," the vault is dimly lit.

The plundered riches of [[Strahd]]'s secret hoard lie within this adamantine tower, which is actually a Daern's instant fortress (see chapter 7, "Treasure," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Only [[Strahd]] knows the command word to alter its shape and size, which can't be done until every bit of treasure inside it is removed. Only [[Strahd]] can open the two means of entry: a sealed adamantine door set into the base of the tower on the north side, and an adamantine trapdoor on the roof.

The arrow slits of the tower are 4 inches wide and 2 feet tall, and the walls of the fortress are 3 inches thick. Characters who are able to reduce their size or assume gaseous form can enter the tower through these slits.

TREASURE

The ground floor of the Daern's instant fortress contains 50,000 cp, 10,000 sp, 10,000 gp, 1 ,000 pp, 15 assorted gems (100 gp each), and a +2 shield emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see chapter 7 ). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't incapacitated.

The upper floor of the tower contains 10 pieces of jew­ elry (250 gp each) in a red velvet sack, an alchemyjug,  
a helm ofbrilliance, a +l rod ofthe pact keeper, and an unlocked wooden coffer with four compartments, each one containing a potion of greater healing.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying atop the coins on the ground floor inside the tower.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with [[Strahd]] in this area, he is perched atop the tower.

K42. KING'S BEDCHAMBER

Sweet smells waft from this delicately lit room. A great arched window along the west wall is covered by heavy red draperies, their golden tassels glinting in the light of three candelabras sitting atop small tables about the room. Tall white candles burn with bright, steady light.  
A large bed, canopied by silk curtains, sits with its headboard against the north wall. Carved into the head­ board with great skill is a large "Z." Lying amid the velvet and satin sheets and bedclothes is a young woman in a nightgown. One of her dainty slippers has fallen to the floor at the bed's foot.

Arched double doors.Jead 'rrom th. is ro·om to the south and east.

The window is divided into four tall panes of glass, each enclosed by a lead framework. The two outermost sections have small iron hinges built into them so that they can be opened, as well as iron latches to lock them .Jn place when they're closed. The window looks out onto the parapet (area K46).

The figure on the bed is Gertruda (NG female human commoner), the daughter of Mad Mary (see chapter 3, area E3). Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to her­ self-especially from [[Strahd]], who has charmed her. Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child. She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty.

Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life. When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice. She is naive to the point of being a danger to her­ self and others. Fortunately for her, [[Strahd]] has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)

Next to the bed, set into the north wall, is a secret door. It can be pushed open to reveal a dusty hall that ends at a similar secret door in the back of an alcove (see area K45 for details). Gertruda doesn't know that this secret door exists.

K43. BATH CHAMBER

Red satin curtains hang in archways at both ends of the south wall in this dark room. Between them, in the cen­ ter of the chamber, stands a large, ornate iron tub with clawed feet. The tub is full of blood.

Both curtamed archways lead to area K44.

TORMENTED SPIRIT

The spirit ofVarushka, a maid, haunts this chamber. She took her own life when [[Strahd]] began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vam­ pire spawn.

The blood in the tub isn't real, but rather a manifesta­ tion ofVarushka's tormented spirit. If the blood is dis­ turbed in any way, read:

A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scut­ tles away.

The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can't be harmed and doesn't attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.

K44. CLOSET

The walls here are lined with iron hooks, upon which hang black capes and formal wear. Two arched windows in the south wall are covered by heavy curtains.

Twenty-eight capes and sixteen sets of fine clothes are stored here. Red satin drapes hang in the archways that connect this closet to the adjoining bath chamber (area K43).

K45. HALL OF HEROES

Dark alcoves line the walls of this long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft's roof are exposed. Lightning from the dark clouds above sporadically illumi­ nates the hall, lighting the faces of life-sized human stat­ ues in the alcoves. Each visage is frozen in terror.

The ten statues that line this corridor depict ancient heroes. In actuality, the faces of the statues are stoic and expressionless, but whenever the lightning flashes, their expressions change to utter horror until the hall goes dark again.

The statues are imbued with the spirits of [[Strahd]]'s ancestors, all of which grieve over the termination of their bloodline. Each spirit will answer one question  
if addressed directly. The spirits' answers are always short and vague, and. there is a 20 percent chance that a spirit's answer is wrong. ··· · ,. ·

The stairs at the west end. of the hall descend 40 feet to area K33. An opeii �tchWay·to the east reveals a tower landing beyqnd (pai:�:ofarea K20).

K46. PARAPETS

You stand on a ten-foot-wide walkway that encircles most of the keep. The drizzle of rain continues, punctuated by the occasional clap of thunder or stroke of lightning. Far below these parapets are the shining wet cobblestones of the courtyard.

The walkway runs around the front of the upper por­ tion of the keep. Battlemented walkways extend from the keep north, south, and east to the outer walls of the castle as well. (See map 2 for the length and location of the castle walls.) All the windows leading from this area into the keep are shut and locked, but can easily be broken.

If the characters loiter on the parapets or atop the castle walls for more than 5 minutes, they encounter [[Strahd]]'s animated armor (see appendix D) making the rounds. It patrols the parapets and the outer walls of Ravenloft day and night. Under a darkened sky, charac­ ters without darkvision are more likely to hear the clat­ ter of the armor approaching before they can see it.

The armor can't be salvaged if it is reduced to 0 hit points.
