K35. GUARDIAN.VERMIN

A door of delicately engraved steel stands at the west end of this short, dark hallway. Intricate details stand out clearly on the door's surface. The door seems to shine with a light of its own, untouched by time. Flanking the door are two alcoves in shadow. A dark, vaguely man­ shaped figure stands in each alcove.

The dark figures are four swarms ofrats piled atop  
one another to form manlike shapes (two swarms per alcove). These rats are under Strahd's control and attack anyone that tries to move through this area.

The steel door is engraved with images of a human king in armor astride a horse, a majestic range of moun­ tains and shooting stars in the background. Tiny figures of people and wolves frame the image.

K36. DINING HALL OF THE COUNT

Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell

of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table,  
a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier  
of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs.

The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of Strahd. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Per­ ception) check.

If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:

Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward. Scattered about the floor are chunks of the moldy cake, as if something had burst out of it.

There are two explanations for the burst cake and bro­ ken window. Choose the one you think is creepier:

-   Strahdsmashesthecakeandbreaksthewindowto make the characters think something terrible has es­ caped and is now stalking them.
    
-   Strahd'shateassumesacorporealform,burstsout of the cake (the symbol of Sergei and Tatyana's love), and escapes through the window. "Strahd's hate" has the statistics of an invisible stalker and tries to kill whichever character is carrying the groom figurine.
    
    The room has wooden doors in the north and west walls, and an ornate steel door in the east wall (see area K35 for details).
    
    The harp stands 6\li feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses. Its taut strings are made of gut.
    
    A character who plays the harp and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check does well enough  
    to summon the ghost of Pidlwick, a short little man dressed as a fool, with a tiny jingling bell at the end of
    
    his pointy dunce cap. He asks, "Why have you sum­ moned me from beyond the grave?" Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, "In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest." If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, "Pidlwick." If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, "I fell down the stairs." If Pidlwick II (see area K59) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, "He pushed me down the stairs."

With nothing more to add, the ghost of Pidlwick fades away and doesn't appear again. If the characters attack the ghost, it attacks them in turn.

TREASURE

The lute, though old and covered in dust, has survived the passage of time. It is a magic instrument ofthe bards called a Doss lute.

K37. STUDY

A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves

of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug.  
In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed  
and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully ren­ dered portrait. It is an exact likeness of lreena Kolyana.

This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.

The painting above the fireplace depicts Tatyana,

a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. Strahd commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Tatyana is proof to Strahd that both women were born with the same soul.

The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for. anyone to reach the secret door safely.

TELEPORT DESTINATION

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in front of the painting of Tatyana.

FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is resting on the mantelpiece under the portrait of Tatyana.

If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting back in one of the over­ stuffed chairs, staring into the fire.

K38. FALSE TREASURY

Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evi­ dence of great workmanship.

Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton's right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.

The coins scattered around the trapped chest total 50

gp, 100 sp, and 2,000.cp.The chest weighs40 pounds and is unlocked.

SECRET DOORS
This room i,s cpncealed behind two secret doors.
The seeret .door. to the west is set into the back wall ... ; o( the·fueplace'.(area K37) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple Jocking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It's pos­ sible that a character might open this secret door inad­ vertently by lifting the poker in area K37. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

The secret door at the northern end of the east wall

is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton's hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Re­ moving the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn't reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.

K39. HALL OF WEBS 

This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.
The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.

Most of the hall is full of giant spider webs (see "Dun­ geon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk be­ coming stuck.

SECRET DOORS

At the west end of the hall are two secret doors.

The secret door on the west wall can't be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a knock spell). See area K38 for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from area K38, it closes and locks behind them if they don't take measures to prop it open.

A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door can be pulled open to reveal area K3lb.

K40. BELFRY

You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.

The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long "GONG." That sound causes five giant spiders to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are at­ tacked or if the bell is sounded.

Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider webs (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5, "Adventure Environ­ ments," of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.

At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.
