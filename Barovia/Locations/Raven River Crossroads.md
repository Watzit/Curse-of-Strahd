Always check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area R.

This stretch of the [[Old Svalich Road]] has multiple branches. One branch heads north, quickly turning into a dirt path that leads toVan Richten's Tower on Lake Baratok (areaV). One branch heads south, becoming [[Tsolenka Pass]] (area T) as it winds through the lower mountains and clings to the side of Mount Ghakis. A third branch heads west toward [[The Wizard of Wines]] winery and vineyard (area W), dipping south as it changes from a road into a gravel trail.

Standing at the intersection of the [[Old Svalich Road]] and the road to the winery is a signpost:

You see a weatherworn signpost next to the road. The three arms of the sign point along the three branches  
of the road. The arm pointing north reads [[KREZK]], and through the woods you can see an arching stone bridge spanning a river. The arm pointing east reads [[Vallaki]], and the road slopes up gradually in that direction. The arm pointing southwest reads THE W1zARD OF W1NES. The road slopes gently downward in that direction.
