The village of Barovia is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of Strahd that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, buried under fog but still unable to hide from the vampire's sight.

Until recently, Strahd had been paying nightly visits to lreena Kolyana, the adopted daughter of the village burgomaster. Ireena carries the soul of Strahd's beloved Tatyana and looks exactly like her. Strahd intends to make Ireena his bride, turn her into a vampire, and lock her away in the castle crypts for all time.

APPROACHING THE VILLAGE

When the characters first approach the village, read:

"Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds everything. T he muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognizable as village dwellings. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness. No sound cuts the silence except for mournful sobbing that echoes through the streets from a distance."



Lying in the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], the village of [[Barovia]] is oppressed by fear. The villagers rarely venture from their homes, suspecting their neighbours of wickedness and fearing evils are taking root in the shadows. Their fears are largely justified, as ghosts and vampire spawn haunt the town, and many locals have been consumed by their own callousness or wicked temptations. A rare exception to the village's cold desperation can be found at the local tavern called the Blood of the Vine. Those few who would oppose [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s evil congregate here and are in turn spied upon by the count's agents.
