Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.

If the characters are traveling in [[Vistani|Vistani]] wagons, they can continue on to the [[village of Barovia]] (area E) without incident.
If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

You catch the scent of death on the air

The character can follow the stench to its source:

The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.

The dead man, Dalvan Olensky, was trying to escape from [[Barovia]] with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]]'s dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to [[NPCs/Strahd/Strahd|Strahd]], the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast.

The letter in Dalvan's hand has a large "B" set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players "Kolyan Indirovich's Letter (Version 2)" in appendix F. The letter is dated one week ago.

Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it and turn back.

If the characters linger in the woods, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of five dire wolves arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave [[Barovia]], these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty wolves. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward the [[village of Barovia]] (area E).
