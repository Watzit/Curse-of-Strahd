Seven secrets of Ravenloft:

1. Ravenloft is not a world. Ravenloft exists as one of the many [[Domains of Dread]].

2. The [[Dark Powers]] control all. The Dark Powers are sinister entities that manipulate the domains themselves and all their inhabitants. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent in their respective plains, the [[Dark Powers]] have no problem with subtlety, manipulating their targets over the course of generations.

3. Domains imprison [[Darklords]]. Many of the demi-planes are used to house Darklords, villains trapped and tormented by the dark powers. The domains themselves are set up at the whim of the [[Dark Powers]] to ironically twist its Darklord's desires, capturing them and their lands' residents in cycles of dread and despair.

4. The [[Mists]] encompass all. Supernatural haze suffuses the Domains of Dread. These are the Mists of Ravenloft, ominous fogs that gird each domain, rising and falling as the [[Dark Powers]] desire. Tales attribute ominous powers to the [[Mists]], from cloaking monsters to causing entire  to vanish. The Mists are not bound to [[Ravenloft]] and slip across the planes, potentially dragging anyone into the [[Domains of Dread]].

5. Nowhere is safe. The [[Mists of Ravenloft]] are notorious for kidnapping innocent souls and trapping them within the Domains of Dread, but they also collect characters to participate in specific terrifying adventures. Ravenloft can claim a soul for one night of terror or for an inescapable nightmare, whichever suits the needs of your adventures.

6. Heroes confront horrors. [[Ravenloft]] is not a land of heroes. Few seek out danger in the [[Mists]] or challenge [[Darklords]]. Fear and forces within characters themselves-potentially in the form of rare lineages or [[Dark Gifts]]-threaten personal dooms. Yet those who face these terrors shine as lights amid the Mists, beacons to attract other heroes but also greater threats.

7. Only fear is certain. The [[Domains of Dread]] provide malleable settings for any kind of horror adventure. As domains are unmoored from conventional reality, anything can happen within their borders. Normal people undergo terrifying transformations, whole villages disappear unnoticed, and the Mists bar every method of escaping a threat. Any surreal development you desire is also the will of the Dark Powers, assuring that the most terrifying possibilities come to pass. As a result, even the most familiar races, magic items, and monsters in the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual have places in Ravenloft, but with twists that make them creepy or mysterious.
