Seven secrets of Ravenloft:

1. Ravenloft is not a world. Ravenloft exists as one of the many [[Domains of Dread]].

2. The [[Dark Powers]] control all. The Dark Powers are sinister entities that manipulate the domains themselves and all their inhabitants. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent in their respective plains, the [[Dark Powers]] have no problem with subtlety, manipulating their targets over the course of generations.

3. Domains imprison [[Darklords]]. Many of the demi-planes are used to house Darklords, villains trapped and tormented by the dark powers. The domains themselves are set up at the whim of the [[Dark Powers]] to ironically twist its Darklord's desires, capturing them and their lands' residents in cycles of dread and despair.

4. The [[Mists]] encompass all. Supernatural haze suffuses the Domains of Dread. These are the Mists of Ravenloft, ominous fogs that gird each domain, rising and falling as the Dark Powers desire. Tales attribute ominous powers to the Mists, from cloaking monsters to causing entire villages

5. Nowhere is safe

6. Heroes confront horrors

7. Only fear is certain.
