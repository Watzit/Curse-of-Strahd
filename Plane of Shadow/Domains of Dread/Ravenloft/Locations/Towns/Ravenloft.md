Seven secrets of Ravenloft:

1. Ravenloft is not a world. Ravenloft exists as one of the many [[Domains of Dread]].

2. The [[Dark Powers]] control all. The Dark Powers are sinister entities that manipulate the domains themselves and all their inhabitants. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent in their respective plains, the [[Dark Powers]] have no problem with subtlety, manipulating their targets over the course of generations.

3. Domains imprison [[Darklords]]. Many of the demi-planes are used to house Darklords, villains trapped and tormented by the dark powers. The domains themselves are set up at the whim of the [[Dark ]]

4. The [[Mists]] encompass all.

5. Nowhere is safe

6. Heroes confront horrors

7. Only fear is certain.
