Known throughout Ravenloft, the Mists are man­ ifestations of the Dark Powers' will. They divide, surround, and isolate every domain, creating fog­ shrouded borders that imprison Darklords within their territories. The Mists slip through the Domains ofDread,risingtoclaimunwittingtravel­ ers or releasing terrors upon unsuspecting villagers. Most infamously, the Mists slither into other worlds to claim innocents, villains, or whole lands, drag­ ging them back to become the newest prisoners of Ravenloft.

Inhabitants of the Domains of Dread know of the Mists and ascribe sinister stories to them, but they accept the Mists as a natural part of their homeland. Many who travel between domains even refer to their world as the Land of the Mists. Any super­ natural happening, inexplicable disappearance, or malicious force can be blamed on the Mists, and those who interact with the Mists or who come from beyond them are met with suspicion. The Mists con­ found travel between domains, whether one wishes to leave a place to reach another land or to escape the realm they're in.

Beyond these truths, the Mists are your tool to establish the boundaries ofyour horror stories. See the "Nature of Ravenloft" section in chapter 3 for details on employing the Mists to focus your horror adventures, leading characters to engage with cer­ tain elements while cloaking others in mystery.
