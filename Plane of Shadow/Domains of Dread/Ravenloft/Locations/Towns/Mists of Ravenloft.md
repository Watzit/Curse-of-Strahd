Known throughout [[Ravenloft]], the Mists are manifestations of the [[Dark Powers]]' will. They divide, surround, and isolate every domain, creating fog-shrouded borders that imprison [[Darklords]] within their territories. The Mists slip through the [[Domains of Dread]], rising to claim unwitting travelers or releasing terrors upon unsuspecting villagers. Most infamously, the Mists slither into other worlds to claim innocents, villains, or whole lands, dragging them back to become the newest prisoners of [[Ravenloft]].

Inhabitants of the [[Domains of Dread]] know of the Mists and ascribe sinister stories to them, but they accept the Mists as a natural part of their homeland. Many who travel between domains even refer to their world as the Land of the Mists. Any supernatural happening, inexplicable disappearance, or malicious force can be blamed on the Mists, and those who interact with the Mists or who come from beyond them are met with suspicion. The Mists confound travel between domains, whether one wishes to leave a place to reach another land or to escape the realm they're in.

Beyond these truths, the Mists are your tool to establish the boundaries ofyour horror stories. See the "Nature of [[Ravenloft]]" section in chapter 3 for details on employing the Mists to focus your horror adventures, leading characters to engage with certain elements while cloaking others in mystery.

The Mists can always b e found at a domain's borders but can also appear in dense banks that rise wherever adventures demand. Such banks might veil strangers or hidden foes, or they can transport those who enter them to distant lands, other domains, or even beyond the [[Domains of Dread]]. The Mists are inscrutable, but they ever serve the schemes of the [[Dark Powers]], delivering creatures wherever these wicked forces desire.

The [[Dark Powers]] also grant [[Darklords]] limited ability to manipulate the Mists surrounding their domains, allowing most to open or close their domains' borders to others on a whim. If a domain's borders are closed, supernatural agitation is obvious to any who approach the Mists. This takes the form of roiling disturbances within the haze, menacing silhouettes, threatening sounds, or other activity themed to the Darklord or domain. Creatures that enter the Mists at this time, including flying creatures, are subject to the following effects:

A creature that starts its turn in the Mists must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. This exhaustion can't be removed while the creature is in the Mists.

• No matter how far a creature travels in the Mists, or which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually ends up back in the domain it left.

• The area within the Mists is heavily obscured (see the Player's Handbook for details).

Most [[Darklords]] can keep their domains' borders closed indefinitely and can reopen them at will. For some [[Darklords]], slightly varied effects manifest when they close their domains. Others are limited in their ability to affect their borders. For each domain, specifics appear in the "Closing the Borders" portion of the section on that domain's Darklord.

If a domain's borders are open, the domain is still not easy to escape from. The area within the Mists remains heavily obscured, but the Mists don't cause creatures to gain levels of exhaustion. Characters intent on passing through the Mists travel for ld6 hours, then roll on the Wandering the Mists table to determine what happens.

Characters emerge on stable ground a mile from

Characters emerge from the Mists inside a struc-

ture somewhere within the domain they tried to

leave, perhaps a cave, crypt, shed, or closet.

Other creatures appear within the Mists. Roll any

die. If you roll an even number, a lost and terrified

commoner appears. Ifyou roll an odd number, 2d6 skeletons or 1 unspeakable horror (see chap- ter 5) appears. After the encounter, another ld6 hours pass, then roll on this table again. Characters emerge from the Mists where they en-

tered to find the domain changed. Perhaps some-

one the characters knew is gone, and no one has

any knowledge ofthem ever existing.
