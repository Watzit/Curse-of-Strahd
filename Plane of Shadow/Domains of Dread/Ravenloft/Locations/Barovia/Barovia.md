In Barovia, the night is a curse. With the dying of the light, wicked souls slip from the darkened spires of [[Castle Ravenloft]] to work the will of an immortal overlord. This is the realm of the vampire [[Count Strahd von Zarovich]], whose depravities have doomed him and countless generations to endlessly repeating cycles of obsession and despair.

The howls of wolves and shrieks of raven swarms echo through the dismal valleys and oppressive forests of Barovia. In isolated communities, superstitious villagers find the brightness in their lives smothered by dread of their aloof overlord, his baleful servants, and ancient evils that fester unopposed. All the domain's residents know to fear the Mists and the long Barovian nights, as through them the Devil Strahd watches and reaches to claim whatever he desires. Yet none realize their torments have played out over and over again, all part of Strahd's plot to claim one victim who has eluded him for generations.



Those familiar with Barovia know the following facts:

-   Barovia is a gloomy realm of valleys isolated by wolf-prowled forests and treacherous mountains. Dense clouds cast the land in perpetual gloom.

-   The land's somber, superstitious people live in small, scattered villages. These communities are each led by a burgomaster who seeks to avoid the ire of the land's aloof lord, [[Count Strahd von Zarovich]]. Strangers are widely viewed with suspicion.

-   Many locals believe Count von Zarovich is a vampire. He dwells in [[Castle Ravenloft]], a citadel from which few return.

-   Vistani bands passing through Barovia are under the protection of the count. This protection stems from a past kindness the Vistani showed the count and from his long association with the fortune-teller Madam Eva. (See "Travelers in the Mists" at the end of this chapter for details on the Vistani.)

-   The stories of Barovia's people are full of hidden evils: treacherous witches, secretive cults, portentous ravens, vicious werewolves, and worse.
