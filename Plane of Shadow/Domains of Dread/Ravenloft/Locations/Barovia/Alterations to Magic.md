The land of Barovia resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane. No spell-not even wish-allows one to escape from Strahd's domain. Astral projection, teleport, plane shift, and similar spells cast for the purpose of leaving Barovia simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the etherealness spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Strahd's domain is pulled back into Barovia upon leaving that plane.

For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as sending), Strahd's domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Barovia, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in Barovia.

While in Barovia, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In ad­ dition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally-with one proviso: Strahd can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell's recipi­ ent, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.

RESURRECTION MADNESS

In Barovia, the souls of the dead are as trapped as the souls of the living. They become caught in the mists and can't travel to the afterlife.

When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in Barovia, likely forever. To determine how this madness is expressed, roll on the Indefinite Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

BAROVIANS

After his armies occupied the valley and slew its inhabi­ tants, Strahd repopulated the area with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.

Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can  
be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby express-  
ing their disapproval of anything that isn't familiar to them. Barovians aren't talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude, Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their cus'tomary silence when they are provoked. They -also have a.social cohesiveness (thrust. upon ,them by their weird circum� stances) that can make tht:-:'m. acftogeth�r· ggainst outsid- ers if a Barovian is mistreat�d. ·
