The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers who live outside civilization, traveling about in horse-drawn, bar­ rel-topped wagons called vardos, which they build them­ selves. Compared to Barovians:they are flamboyant. Vistanidressinbrightclothes,laughoften,ariddrink heartily. As much as they feel at home-in._Strahd's dreary land, they know they can leave it.whenever they" please and aren't damned fo spend eteinity there.

Vistani are silversmiths, copper�miths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entei:_ tainers,.storytelfers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money bytellingfortunesandsellinginforniation.Theyspend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly a� a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.

Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little geron­ tocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder. cl!-rrfes the_ bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.

Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They re­ solve disagreements through contests that end with rec­ onciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. Although they can seem lazy and irresponsible to outsiders, the

Vistani are serious people, quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened. They are merciless when they believe they must be.Vistani who knowingly bring harm or misfortune to others of their kind are ban­ ished-the worst punishment aVistana can imagine, even worse than death.

STRAHD'S VISTANI SERVANTS

During one of Strahd's military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group ofVistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. TheseVistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd de­ clared that allVistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to

the present day. Thus,Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.

Strahd honors his debt to theVistani in part because he envies theVistani way of life-the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admi­ ration of them.

In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, manyVistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king.Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normalVistani, and their hearts are poi­ soned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. TheseVistani will lie to protect the  
vampire, and they fear the con­  
sequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd's

Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the infor­ mation they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventur­ ers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.

VISTANI LORE

Vistani know or believe certain facts about their people and their surroundings. This common lore is summa­ rized here. Characters can learn this information after earning aVistana's trust.

STRAHD VON ZAROVICH

About Strahd, theVistani believe the following:

Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died centu­ ries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him as "the devil Strahd."

Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana. (TheVistani don't know what hap­ pened to her.)

• Strahdnamedhiscastle,Ravenloft,afterhisbeloved mother, Queen Ravenovia. Strangers aren't welcome at the castle without an invitation.

1)rn LAND OF BAROVIA

Vistani know the following facts about Barovia and Barovians:

Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father, KingBarov. Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm.

• Barovians are simple, frightened people. Some have old souls, but many do not. The soulless ones are easy tospot,fortheyknownothingbutfear.Theyhaveno charm, hope, or spark, and they don't cry.

, The [[Old Svalich Road]] passes through Strahd's do­ main. Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string: Krezk to the west,Vallaki in the heart of the valley,andBaroviatotheeast.Strahdhasspiesin each settlement.

BELIEFS AND SUPERSTITIONS

The Vistani have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:

The souls of those who die inBarovia can't escape to

the afterlife. They are prisoners in Strahd's domain.  
, SomeVistaniwomenareblessedwithprescience.Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares

to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.  
A prescient Vistana can't see her own future or  
the future of anotherVistana. It is the burden of theVistani's great gift that their own fates can't

be divined.

Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave con­ sequences for the one who utters such a curse.

VISTANI CURSES

A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can't utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.

The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw

to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the Vistana's proficiency bonus+ theVistana's Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a remove curse spell, a greater restoration $pell, or similar magic.

It doesn't end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect..

When the curse ends, theVistana soffers a harmful psychicbacklash.Theamountofthispsychicdamage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.

The Vistana chooses the curse's effect from the options that follow; otherVistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:

The target's attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can't attune to the cho­ sen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, theVistana takes Sd6 psychic damage.

• The target is blinded, deafened, or both. When this curse ends, theVistana takes Sd6 psychic damage.

EVIL EYE

As an action, aVistana can target a creature within 10 feet that theVistana can see. This magical ability, which theVistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the animal friendship, charm person, or hold person spell (Vistana's choice), but requires neither so­ matic nor material components. The spell save DC is 8 + the caster's proficiency bonus+ the caster's Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana's next turn.

AVistana who uses Evil Eye can't use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against aVistana's Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours.
