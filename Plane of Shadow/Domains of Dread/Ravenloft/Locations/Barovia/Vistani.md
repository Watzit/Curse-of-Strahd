The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers who live outside civilization, traveling about in horse-drawn, bar­ rel-topped wagons called vardos, which they build them­ selves. Compared to Barovians:they are flamboyant. Vistanidressinbrightclothes,laughoften,ariddrink heartily. As much as they feel at home-in._Strahd's dreary land, they know they can leave it.whenever they" please and aren't damned fo spend eteinity there.

Vistani are silversmiths, copper�miths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entei:_ tainers,.storytelfers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money bytellingfortunesandsellinginforniation.Theyspend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly a� a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.

Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little geron­ tocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder. cl!-rrfes the_ bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.

Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They re­ solve disagreements through contests that end with rec­ onciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. Although they can seem lazy and irresponsible to outsiders, the

Vistani are serious people, quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened. They are merciless when they believe they must be.Vistani who knowingly bring harm or misfortune to others of their kind are ban­ ished-the worst punishment aVistana can imagine, even worse than death.

STRAHD'S VISTANI SERVANTS

During one of Strahd's military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group ofVistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. TheseVistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd de­ clared that allVistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to

the present day. Thus,Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.

Strahd honors his debt to theVistani in part because he envies theVistani way of life-the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admi­ ration of them.

In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, manyVistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king.Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normalVistani, and their hearts are poi­ soned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. TheseVistani will lie to protect the  
vampire, and they fear the con­  
sequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd's

Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the infor­ mation they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventur­ ers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.
