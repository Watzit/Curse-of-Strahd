Castle [[Ravenloft]] is [[Count Strahd von Zarovich]]'s accursed sanctuary. Here Strahd committed his bloodiest crimes and began the cycle of despair in which all [[Barovia]] remains locked. Lurking Undead, tormented spirits, and Strahd's other servants haunt the vast castle, each serving the count's schemes; reflecting some aspect of his depraved past; or protecting his coffin, which lies hidden within the castle's vast catacombs. Mementos of lost times and fallen heroes lie scattered throughout the count's home. Strahd keeps these relics close, but that might hold the key to his undoing. Castle [[Ravenloft]] is detailed in the adventure Curse ofStrahd.
