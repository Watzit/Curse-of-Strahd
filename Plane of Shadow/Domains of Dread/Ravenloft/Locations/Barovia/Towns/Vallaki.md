Isolated from the rest of [[Barovia]], Vallaki appears at first as an oddly mirthful place, but this seeming joy is an illusion. The burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich, is convinced happiness holds the key to Vallaki's salvation, and so he convenes festival after bizarre festival with titles such as the Festival of the Blazing Sun, the Promenade of Coffins, and the Wolf's Head Jamboree. Additionally, numerous factions are active within the town, including the [[Keepers of the Feather]] and the priests of Osybus (see "Travelers in the Mists" and "Other Groups," respectively, later in this chapter).
