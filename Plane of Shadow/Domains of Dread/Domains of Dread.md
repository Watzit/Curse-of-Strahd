The Domains of Dread are an unknown number of demi-planes hidden within the [[Plane of Shadow]].

Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts, and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. [[Ravenloft]] is a setting designed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.

The characters in your [[Ravenloft]] adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsistencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The [[Dark Powers]], the [[Mists]], and the nature of domains and [[Darklords]] all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect aspects of the same cause: nightmare logic.

[[Ravenloft]] is inherently a vast nightmare. Most of those who experience its terrors never suspect its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious masterminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in [[Ravenloft]]. The exact limits of the [[Dark Powers]]' influence, the [[Mists]]' reach, and the [[Darklords]]' control over their domains are purposefully vague.

As with any nightmare, the [[Domains of Dread]] aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist not to simulate a believable world, but to terrify. This flexibility provides a powerful tool to upend assumptions of safety and tailor your characters' struggles. It also encourages layers of mysteries about the nature of the setting. Is each domain unique or just one in a series of recurring nightmares? How many forms of [[Castle Ravenloft]] exist, have existed, and will yet reveal themselves in the Mists? What is truth among the Domains of Dread, and how long will that remain certain? The answers are for you to decide.

Domains Are Finite. The domains vary in size from countries or geographic regions to a single city, structure, mobile conveyance, or specific location.

Domains Are Isolated. Each domain is surrounded by the Mists, its boundaries fading away into haze. Domains share neither borders nor common geography, and you can't peer from one domain into another. The environments, cultures, and residents of one domain don't influence those of other domains.

Domains Hold [[Darklords]]. Domains exist to contain and torment a villain. Though [[Darklords]] exert control over their domains, they are each tormented by a personal terror playing out in their realm.

Domains Are Cages. Those who run afoul of a Darklord might find that the Mists prevent them from leaving the villain's domain. Like a haunted house that conveniently seals its doors or summons a deadly storm, so do domains create inescapable spaces where horror adventures unfold.

Domains Are Themed. Each domain reflects its Darklord and facilitates horror tales related to that villain. Just as creepy manors suit ghostly inhabitants, so does each domain inspire and encourage a distinct type of terror.

The realities o f the Domains o f Dread seem strange or impossible to individuals from other worlds, but for those who live among the Mists, they're facts of life. With no basis for comparison, domain inhabitants call those who speak of other worlds liars. For them, the following topics are standard aspects of life in their home domain or in a broader collection of domains they call the Land of the Mists.

CULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY

Each domain boasts its own culture, either drawn from the Material Plane or a parody manufactured to torment a [[Darklord]]. As such, a domain might exhibit traditions and technologies unheard of i n other domains. The specifics of each domain's technological advancements are left to you. Ifyou wish domains to feature cutting-edge weird science or inventions such as firearms (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), feel free to do so. Regardless of a domain's culture and innovations, the Mists prevent knowledge of them from spreading. Even if an innovation is taken from one domain to another, the suspicion of the new domain's inhabitants prevents it from gaining acceptance. Such is the subtle control ofthe [[Dark Powers]], ensuring their nightmare realms remain just so.

CURRENCY

Many domains mint their own gold, silver, and copper coins. Though these currencies bear different markings, merchants aren't particular about the designs stamped on coinage. A gold piece from [[Barovia]] spends as well in Borca as it does in Har'Akir, as long as it weighs true. Platinum and electrum coins rarely circulate through the domains, but they appear often enough-originating from hidden troves or ancient vaults-that no trader questions their value.

LANGUAGES

By impossible coincidence, all domains share a language despite their profoundly different origins: Common, which functions as a shared tongue throughout the Land of the Mists. Beyond this, all the other languages noted in the Player's Handbook and Monster Manual are spoken among the [[Domains of Dread]], some more pervasively than others. The same language spoken in multiple domains might bear subtle differences or unique words. Speakers from different domains might also have distinct accents, but their words are understandable.

DM Option: Domain Languages. If you want to highlight the differences between domains, you can do away with Common and decide that the inhabitants of each domain speak their own unique language, which either take the name of their domain or a culturally specific name. For example, the language of [[Barovia]] could be Barovian or Balok. The languages of specific races, such as Elvish or Dwarvish, remain the same in every domain. Those who wish to learn a domain's language can do so using the training downtime activity (see the Player's Handbook). Although it takes 250 days to gain mastery of a language, consider allowing characters to navigate basic social interactions-such as asking for directions or conveying peaceful intentions-after 7 days of training.

RELIGION

In many domains, locals maintain chilly relationships with aloof deities, knowing "the gods" only through hollow rituals and clergy with scant supernatural powers. Conversely, some people privately worship ancestral gods-deities of their family's tradition with whom they form deep, personal connections. Divergent faiths abound, and some that begin as charlatanry inexplicably gain the power of true faith. Ultimately, any deity from the Player's Handbook or any other setting might find followers among the [[Domains of Dread]]. By the same token, the [[Dark Powers]] breathe life into the beliefs of cruel practices and the faiths of false zealots.

One noteworthy exception to this is the worship of the god Ezra, which has its origins in the Mists (see the "Ezra, God of the Mists" sidebar). For your adventures, you define what deities are worshiped in a domain and whether those deities are actual gods, manifestations of the Dark Powers, or one masquerading as the other.

TIME AND DATES

The [[Domains of Dread]] don't share a unified calendar. However, in most domains, locals measure time by "moons" rather than months. As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles. While domains don't ascribe to a shared history, the populace of all domains inexplicably accept the current year as 735. Some local histories cleave to anomalous dates and methods of tracking years, but these are considered obsolete. No such irregularities exist in [[Barovia]], though, where year 1 corresponds with the founding of [[Barovia]] by the von Zarovich family.

TRAVEL AND CORRESPONDENCE

In some domains, the residents are aware that realms exist beyond the Mists, but most have little interest in lands beyond their own. The [[Darklords]]' obsessions distract them from concerns about the nature of their domains or what lies beyond the [[Mists]]. This preoccupation, along with the lack of shared borders or reliable travel, means that mercantile ventures and military conquests between domains are essentially impossible.

Rare individuals do travel between the domains, such as adventurers or roving [[Vistani]] families (detailed at the end of this chapter). Others who wish to travel from one domain to another might wander into the Mists hoping to be carried elsewhere, or they can employ Mist talismans to guide them.

Due to the danger and unreliability of traveling the Mists, those few with interests beyond their home domains make letter writing their preferred method of communication. A group called the Keepers of the Feather (detailed in the "Travelers in the Mists" section later in this chapter) oversees a private network of carrier ravens that possesses the uncanny ability to navigate the Mists. These ravens deliver envelopes and tiny parcels between private rookÂ­ eries maintained by the Keepers. Individuals and businesses friendly with the Keepers-such as a village notary or inn-might surreptitiously contract their services, allowing customers to send a letter for 1 gp. These letters must include a destination where another Keeper can receive them, then either hold or deliver the correspondence-with delivery costs an additional 1 gp. Letters take at least one day to deliver. The Keepers of the Feather make no assurances about the safe delivery of letters in their charge, but their services prove relatively reliable. Rumors speak of more expensive services the Keepers provide to select clients, such as delivery to individuals whose whereabouts are unknown or verbal messages relayed by talking ravens.
