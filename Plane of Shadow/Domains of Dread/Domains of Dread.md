The Domains of Dread are an unknown number of demi-planes hidden within the [[Plane of Shadow]].

Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts, and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. [[Ravenloft]] is a setting designed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.

The characters in your [[Ravenloft]] adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsistencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The [[Dark Powers]], the [[Mists]], and the nature of domains and [[Darklords]] all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect aspects of the same cause: nightmare logic.

[[Ravenloft]] is inherently a vast nightmare. Most of those who experience its terrors never suspect its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious masterminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in [[Ravenloft]]. The exact limits of the [[Dark Powers]]' influence, the [[Mists]]' reach, and the [[Darklords]]' control over their domains are purposefully vague.

As with any nightmare, the [[Domains of Dread]] aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist not to simulate a believable world, but to terrify. This flexibility provides a powerful tool to upend assumptions of safety and tailor your characters' struggles. It also encourages layers of mysteries about the nature of the setting. Is each domain unique or just one in a series of recurring nightmares? How many forms of [[Castle Ravenloft]] exist, have existed, and will yet reveal themselves in the Mists? What is truth among the Domains of Dread, and how long will that remain certain? The answers are for you to decide.

Domains Are Finite. The domains vary in size from countries or geographic regions to a single city, structure, mobile conveyance, or specific location.

Domains Are Isolated. Each domain is surrounded by the Mists, its boundaries fading away into haze. Domains share neither borders nor common geography, and you can't peer from one domain into another. The environments, cultures, and residents of one domain don't influence those of other domains.

Domains Hold [[Darklords]]. Domains exist to contain and torment a villain. Though [[Darklords]] exert control over their domains, they are each tormented by a personal terror playing out in their realm.

Domains Are Cages. Those who run afoul of a Darklord might find that the Mists prevent them from leaving the villain's domain. Like a haunted house that conveniently seals its doors or summons a deadly storm, so do domains create inescapable spaces where horror adventures unfold.

Domains Are Themed. Each domain reflects its Darklord and facilitates horror tales related to that villain. Just as creepy manors suit ghostly inhabitants, so does each domain inspire and encourage a distinct type of terror.
