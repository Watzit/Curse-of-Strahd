The Domains of Dread are an unknown number of demi-planes hidden within the [[Plane of Shadow]].

Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts,

and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. Ravenloft is a setting de­ signed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.

The characters in your Ravenloft adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsis­ tencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The Dark Powers, the Mists, and the nature of domains and Darklords all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect as­ pects of the same cause: nightmare logic.

Ravenloft is inherently a vast nightmare. Most

of those who experience its terrors never suspect

its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious mas­ terminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in Ravenloft. The exact limits of the Dark Powers' influence, the Mists' reach, and the Darklords' con­ trol over their domains are purposefully vague.

As with any nightmare, the Domains of Dread aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist
