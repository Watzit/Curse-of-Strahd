Central to each domain is a Darklord, the seed from which a thorny thicket blooms. The villain might  
be a nation's leader, a prominent citizen, a notorious monster, a mysterious recluse, or a seemingly innocuous character. Regardless of the Darklord's current role, their wickedness led to the creation of their domain and their imprisonment in [[Ravenloft]].

Though these individuals vary widely and exceptions occur, Darklords share a number of qualities:

Darklords Are Evil. Each Darklord is the ultimate villain of a domain and the root of the suffering and terror that unfold there.

Darklords Are Prisoners. Darklords cannot leave their domains. If a Darklord enters the Mists or uses another method to attempt an escape, the [[Dark Powers]] return them to their domain. Even death rarely allows a Darklord to escape their prison for long.

Darklords Are Tormented. Every domain torments its Darklord in a poignant way tied ironically  
to their past crimes, failures, or unattainable ambitions.

Darklords Influence Domains. Although Darklords hate their domains, they exert considerable control over them. This might be the influence of a governmental leader, the magic of a supernatural overlord, or a more fundamental connection. Most possess the ability to prevent others from leaving their domains.

Darklords Vary in Threat. Darklords range from monstrous tyrants to depraved individuals who otherwise appear as ordinary people. A Darklord's position and powers stem from their deeds, not their game statistics. While some Darklords are deadly or possess foul gifts from the [[Dark Powers]], many pose little threat in battle. Their menace is the result of capabilities beyond physical prowess.

Darklords Are Active. Darklords might brood over their failures, but nevertheless they relentlessly strive to achieve their ambitions. Their desperate struggles fuel their conflicts with characters. Liberally use Darklords in your adventures rather than saving them for distant climactic plots.

Darklords Don't Realize They're Darklords. With a few exceptions, Darklords don't realize they occupy a special place in the world. Their agendas, obsessions, and egotism distract them from focusing on the strangeness of the world and petty concerns such as eerie fog.

Darklords Are Immortal. Darklords are casually immortal, many having no concept of how long they've lived, how many times they've died, or why they returned to life. Should a Darklord fall, the temporary defeat lasts until they're restored by the [[Dark Powers]]. In their absence, those who sought to escape or supplant them seize their chance.
